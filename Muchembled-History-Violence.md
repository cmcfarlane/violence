Introduction

1:  "From the thirteenth to the twenty-first century, physical violence and brutality in human relationships were on a downward trajectory all over Western Europe. This is shown by the curve of homicides recorded in the judicial archives. The very high level of seven centuries ago first fell, by roughly half, in the years 1600--50. This was followed by a spectacular fall over the next three centuries, up to the 1960s, in which the number of cases dropped to a tenth of what it had been; subsequent decades have seen a slight but clear increase. Yet, throughout this period, age and sex patterns in the case of murder have remained remarkably constant, which raises many questions."

    The rate of homicide by females has remain constant since the end of the Middle Ages: roughly 10%.

    Most homicides are committed by males twenty to thirty years old.

    Within Europe, there is a clear separation between the former USSR and Western Europe. In Russia, the murder rate was 28.4 per 100,000 in 2000; it comparison, it ranged between 0.7 and 1.9 in the European Community.

1:  Europe has managed to develop an effective system "for the management of male, and especially juvenile, violence."

1:  wars "require a different type of analysis"

1:  The changes since 1960 "may indicate a disturbing reversal of the trend."

2:  How to explain this? Some social scientists take aggression to be a biological fact. However, we must distinguish aggression from violence, "which is its ethical shaping by a civilization."

2:  The decrease in violence is primarily due to "the decrease in the number of fights between young males" and takes two forms. First, among the elite, the gradual disappearance of the duel; second, among the common, the gradual disappearance of "frequent manly confrontations and knife fights in public places." Both are attributable to the "radical change in the masculine notion of honour and in the pacification of human relations" in (1) public places and (2) the family. This is an aspect of what Norbert Elias has called the civilizing process.

2:  "Male aggression, though a biological reality, is also strongly influenced by society, religion and the state. The relatively rare appearance of women in this context is due to two factors. They do not often kill or injure each other, and when they are struck by men, it tends to be with a degree of moderation, as the latter often avoid sustained attacks on their faces, bellies or reproductive organs. This phenomenon may be explained by a natural inhibiting mechanism, which is useful for the survival of the species. However, it was also a result of imperative cultural models which required the daughters of Eve to demonstrate a gentleness specific to their sex, refrain from brutality and never carry a weapon."

2:  "the culture of violence has been essentially masculine in our world."

2:  "Under pressure from the legal system, its status gradually changed from that of a normal collective language, which had created social ties, and helped to validate the hierarchies of power and the relations between generations and sexes in the core communities, to that of a major taboo."

2:  "The West invented adolescence by way of a stronger symbolic tutelage over unmarried men. This process complemented the efforts of a new educational system intended to keep under much closer supervision an age group seen by the established authorities and adults as particularly turbulent, insubordinate and dangerous."

2:  "It was designed to limit the 'natural' aggression of the new male generations by imposing the prohibition of murder, with the increasing approval of the adults of their localities."

2-3;  "The principle change came around 1650, when, everywhere in a Europe ravaged by interminable wars, a strong hostility developed to the sight of blood. From this time on, the Western 'factory' reshaped individual behaviour, which was habitually violent, especially among the young, by a system of norms and rules of politeness which devalued armed confrontations, codes of personal vengeance, excessively harsh hierarchical relationships and relations between the sexes and age groups. This resulted, over the centuries, in a veritable transformation of the collective sensibility with regard to homicide, which culminated, during the industrial age, in its becoming a powerful taboo."

3:  "This change was not painless, except for many townspeople, who were much less hostile to being 'disarmed'. This was because the 'urban peace' had already, by the end of the late Middle Ages, lessened the violence of the inhabitants of towns more effectively than elsewhere." e.g., police

    Notable groups opposing this transformation were (1) the aristocrats, who developed a culture of honour and duelling, which was reoriented towards the military in defence of, first, the prince and then, second, the nation and (2) the peasants, constituting the vast majority of the European population until the nineteenth century, fought to preserve its manly traditions, including through rather unsuccessful and violent armed revolts. 

3:  "More recently, the sudden emergence at the end of the twentieth century of the problems posed by the young rioters of the inner cities gives the impression that there has been a return of the repressed."

4:  "Even more than that of incest, the prohibition on male violence slowly turned into an obsession."
