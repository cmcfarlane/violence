Introduction
--

1:  "From the thirteenth to the twenty-first century, physical violence and brutality in human relationships were on a downward trajectory all over Western Europe. This is shown by the curve of homicides recorded in the judicial archives. The very high level of seven centuries ago first fell, by roughly half, in the years 1600--50. This was followed by a spectacular fall over the next three centuries, up to the 1960s, in which the number of cases dropped to a tenth of what it had been; subsequent decades have seen a slight but clear increase. Yet, throughout this period, age and sex patterns in the case of murder have remained remarkably constant, which raises many questions."

	The rate of homicide by females has remain constant since the end of the Middle Ages: roughly 10%.

	Most homicides are committed by males twenty to thirty years old.

	Within Europe, there is a clear separation between the former USSR and Western Europe. In Russia, the murder rate was 28.4 per 100,000 in 2000; it comparison, it ranged between 0.7 and 1.9 in the European Community.

1:  Europe has managed to develop an effective system "for the management of male, and especially juvenile, violence."

1:  wars "require a different type of analysis"

1:  The changes since 1960 "may indicate a disturbing reversal of the trend."

2:  How to explain this? Some social scientists take aggression to be a biological fact. However, we must distinguish aggression from violence, "which is its ethical shaping by a civilization."

2:  The decrease in violence is primarily due to "the decrease in the number of fights between young males" and takes two forms. First, among the elite, the gradual disappearance of the duel; second, among the common, the gradual disappearance of "frequent manly confrontations and knife fights in public places." Both are attributable to the "radical change in the masculine notion of honour and in the pacification of human relations" in (1) public places and (2) the family. This is an aspect of what Norbert Elias has called the civilizing process.

2:  "Male aggression, though a biological reality, is also strongly influenced by society, religion and the state. The relatively rare appearance of women in this context is due to two factors. They do not often kill or injure each other, and when they are struck by men, it tends to be with a degree of moderation, as the latter often avoid sustained attacks on their faces, bellies or reproductive organs. This phenomenon may be explained by a natural inhibiting mechanism, which is useful for the survival of the species. However, it was also a result of imperative cultural models which required the daughters of Eve to demonstrate a gentleness specific to their sex, refrain from brutality and never carry a weapon."

2:  "the culture of violence has been essentially masculine in our world."

2:  "Under pressure from the legal system, its status gradually changed from that of a normal collective language, which had created social ties, and helped to validate the hierarchies of power and the relations between generations and sexes in the core communities, to that of a major taboo."

2:  "The West invented adolescence by way of a stronger symbolic tutelage over unmarried men. This process complemented the efforts of a new educational system intended to keep under much closer supervision an age group seen by the established authorities and adults as particularly turbulent, insubordinate and dangerous."

2:  "It was designed to limit the 'natural' aggression of the new male generations by imposing the prohibition of murder, with the increasing approval of the adults of their localities."

2-3;  "The principle change came around 1650, when, everywhere in a Europe ravaged by interminable wars, a strong hostility developed to the sight of blood. From this time on, the Western 'factory' reshaped individual behaviour, which was habitually violent, especially among the young, by a system of norms and rules of politeness which devalued armed confrontations, codes of personal vengeance, excessively harsh hierarchical relationships and relations between the sexes and age groups. This resulted, over the centuries, in a veritable transformation of the collective sensibility with regard to homicide, which culminated, during the industrial age, in its becoming a powerful taboo."

3:  "This change was not painless, except for many townspeople, who were much less hostile to being 'disarmed'. This was because the 'urban peace' had already, by the end of the late Middle Ages, lessened the violence of the inhabitants of towns more effectively than elsewhere." e.g., police

	Notable groups opposing this transformation were (1) the aristocrats, who developed a culture of honour and duelling, which was reoriented towards the military in defence of, first, the prince and then, second, the nation and (2) the peasants, constituting the vast majority of the European population until the nineteenth century, fought to preserve its manly traditions, including through rather unsuccessful and violent armed revolts. 

3:  "More recently, the sudden emergence at the end of the twentieth century of the problems posed by the young rioters of the inner cities gives the impression that there has been a return of the repressed."

4:  "Even more than that of incest, the prohibition on male violence slowly turned into an obsession."

4:  "But it seems, at least, that there has been since the end of the Middle Ages a strong general correlation between outbreaks of juvenile violence and a disruption, for one reason or another, of the procedures for managing the replacement of the generations on European soil."

Chapter 1: What is Violence?
--

7:  "violence" derives from L. *vis* meaning force or vigour. Appeared in French at beginning of thirteenth century, "characterized a quick-tempered and brutal person." "It also described a power relationship aimed at subjecting or constraining another person." 

7:  "Western civilization gave violence a fundamental role. On the one hand, it fiercely denounced the excesses of violence and declared it illegitimate, recalling that diving law forbade the killing of another person; on the other, it gave violence an elevated, positive role and declared it legitimate, to validate the action of the knight who shed blood in defence of widows and orphans, and to defend the 'just' wars waged by Christian kings against the Infidel, troublemakers and enemies of the prince."

7:  "It has slowly and painfully exorcized the problem, and now regards human life as sacred and homicide as a major taboo."

	Note the religious language surrounding human bodies, lives and violence.

8:  "A true 'culture of war' has presided from its origins over the development of the West, even intensifying with the Great Discoveries."

8:  "Western culture was fertile territory for other types of violence because it was based on a manly ethic which elevated brute force into a model of behaviour, particularly in the profoundly unequal societies of the Middle Ages and the *ancien régime*. The second sex was left with little more than the role of weak, unarmed women, necessarily dependent, protected by males who derived pleasure from them and demanded they provide them with sons to continue the lineage. Nobles or commoners, powerful or weak, all men were educated in the context of a 'culture of violence' based on the need to defend masculine honour against rivals. The brutality of human relations was a universal social language, considered normal and necessary in the West until at least the seventeenth century. Until its slow monopolization by the state and the nation, violence shaped the masculine personality according to the noble model of manliness and the mastery of the use of weapons demanded of every aristocrat; it thus created, in opposition, the model of the weak woman. Until the disarmament of the ordinary population, which was slowly and painfully achieved on princely orders from the seventeenth century, the lowest male shared this ethic and wielded a knife or sword with ease and without much respect for human life."

8-9:  "The social sciences, those remarkable products of the Western genius in the nineteenth century, have recently turned their attention to the question of homicidal violence. Their common discourse of devaluation with regard to this 'criminal' phenomenon usually ignores its socially structuring aspects and the positive forms it could assume in the eyes of both actors and governments in the Middle Ages and the sixteenth century. We need to go back to this fact if we are to achieve a proper understanding of the problem and reveal the causes of the massive changes of the last five hundred years."

9:  "In legal terms, violence designates crimes against persons, including homicide, assault and rape. The classification of these phenomena is not the same in all countries and at all periods.... Specialists in the *ancien régime* generally omit infanticide, on the grounds that it is particularly under-recorded. Offences against property form a separate category today, although some robberies are accompanied by aggravated, even lethal, violence. The statistics for the anglophone countries, both recent and old, clearly distinguish two types of homicide, premediated and unpremediated, the latter designated as manslaughter. Such a lack of standardization illustrates wide differences in the way homicide has been perceived in the various countries, and even more the various periods, considered here."

9:  "The general characteristics of homicide pose a major puzzle. The profile of the typical offender has changed very little since the thirteenth century, in spite of the considerable decline in recorded numbers observed all over in Europe. Women are in a tiny minority. The majority of murderers are young men aged between twenty and twenty-nine. Under the *ancien régime*, their victims often resembled them in age and sex and the murderous confrontations usually revolved round issues of rights, precedence and honour. Members of the wealthiest and most privileged groups were no less involved than others. The marked decline in lethal violence from the seventeenth century seems to be linked both to the general pacification of public space and to the abandonment by young men of good families of this type of confrontation; they turned instead to duels, until these were, in due course, criminalized. Most lethal violence continues today to be committed by young men who are poorly qualified and come largely from working-class or poor backgrounds. This reveals not only an economic and social divide, but a major cultural difference: violent behaviour has been more quickly and more easily eradicated by education, morality and pervading pressures among young men from the upper social ranks."

10:  "These observations suggest that violence is not a purely innate phenomenon. It can be distinguished from aggression, which is a potentiality for violence, whose destructive power can be inhibited by civilizations--if they decide to do this, and if there is sufficient acceptance among those affected for their views to be imposed."

10:  "Our civilization has resolved this major contradiction by adopting a very fluid semantic use of the concept of violence. It has, at the same time, imposed a blanket prohibition on it. Specialists distinguish two antagonistic meanings of the term. The first identifies the violence at the heart of life: all living creatures are driven to predatory or defensive behaviour when threatened. But man is not an ordinary animal, it is argued, and he is without a conscious desire to destroy his fellows."

11:  "At most, they [historians] may note that past centuries have bequeathed us a double conception of violence: legitimate when employed by institutions, such as states when they wage war, or churches when they persecute 'heretics'; illegitimate when committed by individuals in opposition to the law or morality. This fundamental ambiguity stems from the fact that human violence is both biological and cultural."

13:  "Yet destructive aggression is a male affair. In contemporary Europe, only 10 per cent of murderers are women, which was also the case in thirteenth-century England. The variations recorded in the seven centuries since have been slight." 

13:  "For the latter, it is the construction of human beings by their culture that is important. The essential link is not that between violence and masculinity, because this is a biological given. It is that established with manliness, a notion defined by each society in the context of the determination of the sexual 'genders' whose existence it recognizes. Until quite recently, the West accepted only two, and established a powerful functional inequality between them."

14:  "The crime that is most feared, like paedophilia in France today, is the one that represents an intolerable threat to the collective values on which the permanence of a civilization is based. In which case, the punishment far exceeds the crime, so as to allow a general repair of the torn social and cultural fabric."

14:  "Its real acceptance can even be dated to the age of the absolute monarchs, when a massive theoretical and judicial effort was made to 'discipline' populations appalled by the terrible Wars of Religion between 1562 and 1648. With the restoration of order, at different dates in different countries, male homicide and female infanticide were made inexpiable crimes. The death penalty was employed much more frequently than in the past for these offences, and it performed a symbolic function by defining the supreme danger, and eradicating it."

15:  Referring to lese-majesty and grotesque executions, such as of Ravaillac and Damiens. "One of the most visible signs of its success was its progress, however gradual, in disarming populations, curtailing the excesses of the noble duel and punishing the most dangerous criminals. The system provided a growing sense of security."

15:  "The number of homicides fell sharply in Western Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century, whereas the number of death penalties for this crime greatly increased. Whereas murder and the killing of newborn babies had previously been regarded as fairly banal occurrences, only half-heartedly and not very effectively pursued by the courts, these now assumed the status of major crimes and became closely bound up with the concept of lese-majesty. In the eighteenth century, the priorities shifted once again, in the direction of crimes against property, at a time of strong economic and commercial growth. In both England and France, the two great rivals on the European and world stage, robbery became, in its turn, the most unacceptable of crimes. Death sentences were increasingly often passed on those guilty of it, especially in London and Paris, the two greatest commercial centres in Europe."

16:  "The emergence of a new type of serious crime and, in its wake, a harsher repression of associated transgressions is a consequence of a change in the basic values underpinning this culture. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the judicial focus in the West has shifted again. The worst crimes are now linked to the preservation of the lives and sexual innocence of children. At a time when the death penalty has been abolished in Europe, it is symptomatic that those who talk of possible exceptions refer to this threat to children, now designated as the most unspeakable crime that a human being can commit."

16:  "By brandishing the threat of the death penalty for those who dared to kill, they strengthened their control over their subjects. This had not been the case in the European societies of the immediately preceding centuries. Then less strictly controlled by the state, they had allowed more latitude to the local and regarded the death of a human being with a degree of indifference, in the context of a culture in which male violence was the norm."

	Muchembled notes, "In these circumstances, aggression had a positive value." Aggression and violence have a valence and that valence is culturally determined.
	
16-7:  "Male murderers were treated even more leniently if they were young, because the adults of their locality tolerated displays of violence in the belief that youth must have its fling. It is because of this that it was young men aged between twenty and twenty-nine who were most likely to commit murder. During their long wait for marriage, both in the countryside and in the towns, young men in this age group adopted a culture of bachelor gangs. These were based on competition between peers to enhance their value in the eyes of the girls and to compensate for the frustrations associated with this uncomfortable state, between childhood and full adulthood. Their principal concern was to extol a manliness which made them exist in the eyes of others. They carried weapons, in particular knives or swords, and used them freely in fights intended to demonstrate their valour, inflicting or receiving wounds which infection and the inadequacies of contemporary medicine often rendered fatal. Young noblemen, trained for combat and imbued with an equally manly warrior ethic, were not fundamentally different in this regard from the peasantry, before their isolation after the invention of the rules of the aristocratic duel in the sixteenth century."

17:  "Not all unmarried men were killers. Only a tiny minority committed murder. The highest homicide rate recorded for the thirteenth century is a little over 100 murders for every 100,000 inhabitants. Given that women were rarely involved, we may deduce a maximum of 100 murderers for every 50,000 men, all ages included, that is, about 0.2 per cent of the contingent. Young unmarried men probably accounted for scarcely more than a fifth of the male population in the demographic conditions of the time and provided less than half this total. In other words, at most one young man in a thousand committed murder. To kill one of one's peers was by no means the norm, even if it happened a hundred times more often than in our own day."

17:  "The homicide rate fell on average to 10 per 100,000 in the first half of the seventeenth century. The decline is spectacular. There was a tenfold decline in the number of young male murderers, a sign of the retreat of the culture of manly violence in the face of the advance of a new intolerance, conveyed by many other means than the law alone. The Western 'factory' was inventing adolescence as a dangerous age, which must be closely controlled so as to prevent it lethal excesses. After that, the trend speeded up, to produce a rate of around 1 per cent in the middle of the twentieth century, a hundred times lower than in the Middle Ages."

18:  "In the England of the early twenty-first century, homicide is primarily a male affair. The murderer and his victim usually know each other, or are even related, and, in nearly half of all cases, they have quarrelled. They are mostly aged between sixteen and thirty-five. The most common weapon, used in 28 per cent of cases, is a sharp implement."

18:  "Homicide is a social construction."

18:  "The principal target in the case of murder is the young male, impatiently waiting to reach maturity and accede to the advantages of adult life, who transgresses the most sacred codes by killing one of his peer group. On the one hand, society urges him to define himself by reference to an ethic of manliness; on the other, it exhorts him to keep his cool and learn the self-control necessary to avoid this inexpiable crime. It forbids him to engage in illegitimate physical violence, the latter defined in opposition to the violence decreed by the community and employed in its service, for example in the just war."

18:  "The rapid decline in homicide rates since the seventeenth century testifies to the increasing success of social control in this sphere. Murder has become a residual phenomenon in our societies. So far has this gone that aggression is now primarily associated with society's marginals and losers."

18-9:  "The distaste for blood and the taboo on violence have been the cornerstones of the Western system since it embarked on the conquest of the globe some five hundred years ago. Stamped with the seal of absolute illegitimacy in the internal relations of societies these have enabled states to appropriate a monopoly of legitimate force, both in war and in the use of the death penalty, until its recent abolition. They have also helped to assure the least conflictual possible transmission between generations, by making the implicit contract forged between them dependent on the younger generation acquiring mechanisms for the pacification of their behaviour. The management of the patrimony must continue to be assured on the previous model, by good family men, so that the hard core of murderers, often from poor backgrounds, can all the more justifiably be excluded from the 'normal' succession. When the young become too numerous, after a period of peace and demographic growth, intergenerational tensions increase and youth violence returns in a big way."

19:  "The taming of manly aggression was part of a wider phenomenon, the social and cultural pact on which the state and the whole of Western civilization were based. This aggression, a biological reality, was strongly shaped and oriented by the dominant forces for cohesion, in order to produce an exemplary ordinary subject who was not constantly challenging the values or norms of his community, national or local. Europe achieved the feat of producing sociability on the basis of a particularly unstable element, the sexuality of young men."

19-20:  "The pivot on which everything turned was manliness. Until the changes of the late twentieth century, the position of the male, whatever his social status, was strongly correlated with the assertion of his heterosexuality, but much less than before with the need to demonstrate it violently in the theatre of everyday life. Women, meanwhile, had to remain in their place so as to confirm the man as a man. The passivity required by the cultural norms constructed the woman as a gentle and helpless creature, normally incapable of murderous violence. A woman who behaved aggressively seemed abnormal, even totally Other."

20:  "The child was now seen as innocent by nature. If one child killed another, that child was assumed to be profoundly evil or diabolic."

20:  "Our civilization no longer wants to contemplate violence by women and probably underestimates the violence they suffer. It has for centuries preferred to focus on the 'civilizing woman', whose mission is to soften behaviour, turn men away from violence and restrain the brutality of their sexual desires. While it is clear that women play a fundamental role in cultural transmission, nothing proves that they have always conceived their role as that of docile and obedient sheep."

21:  "It [female violence] was still part of a 'culture of violence' which extended to the whole of the population. Children were brought up both to suffer violence and to practise it. Little shepherd boys defended their territory against the flocks of other villages, using their crooks and slings, causing serious and sometimes fatal injuries to adversaries of their own aga. Everybody was violent at the end of the Middle Ages and in early modern times."

21:  "There were precise codes and rituals regulating the brutality of human relations. In this world of proximity, a strict sense of honour obliged men to avenge not only their own honour, which was based on the overt demonstration of manliness, but that of their whole family group, while women were kept closely supervised to protect their sexual purity or their virtue."

21-2:  "The juvenile culture of violence in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century West was based on identical rules. The sharp implement, sword or knife, was a symbolic representation of the individual, who endured an extended purgatory between childhood and marriage, and who had to prove that he was capable of acceding to manhood. Young men banded together into gangs in the evening after work and on Sundays and holidays. Their aggression was mainly directed against each other, as they were competitors in a tight marriage market. The rest of the time, they flirted with girls, often collectively. THey went to great lengths to win their sexual favours. This was in spite of the close watch kept on young girls, not only by their fathers and brothers, but by the women of all ages who surrounded them whenever they were at risk, especially during the collective evening get-togethers or in the fields, at the wash-house or at the mill. The position of grown lads was an uncomfortable one; they represented a third population group, in relation to the dominant adult males and the weaker sex, as female sociability encompassed all ages and even included pre-pubescent boys. In this context, the injuries inflicted and murders committed by young men were treated indulgently by their elders, by the local authorities, by the law and by the king himself, who was free with his pardons. This was probably a price that had to be paid to prevent bachelors, frustrated and kept in close tutelage, from more frequently turning on the established males who monopolized power and women. In any case it encouraged a regular cycle of extreme violence, ruled by the law of honour and the law of vengeance."

22:  "The transition from private vengeance, based on the collective defence of honour, to the banning of homicide was neither quickly nor easily achieved. The first, and most rapid, stage, which took some two centuries, involved separating young men of good family from the common, violent cultural model. The invention of the meticulously codified duel helped to make this possible."

22:  "Periods of crisis in the transmission of values, at times of juvenile overpopulation, led to their revival on a significant scale at fairly regular intervals. The members of inner-city gangs at the beginning of the twenty-first century are practising a concept of manly honour which was some echoes to that of the young men of earlier centuries, in that the destructive effects of their aggression are felt primarily by their peers. This can still be seen as a mechanism that allows some of it to be deflected away from adults, even though it is the latter who are primarily responsible for the strict controls imposed on these young men."

23:  Homicide is residual in Europe, but much more prevalent in other places: United States, Russia, Eastern Europe.

23:  Must pay attention to (1) male, (2) twenty to twenty-nine. "A satisfactory explanation can only be found in the long term, and must give due weight to the problem of the transition to full adulthood."

23:  "Economic conditions have a role in determining levels of human aggression, but they are not, on their own, a sufficient explanation. The peaks of youth violence are not closely correlated with a general deterioration in living standards, but rather with situations of demographic surplus, against a backdrop of malaise caused by particular difficulties in integrating, for example in the banlieues of Paris today."

23-4:  "Elias identified a new model of the individual, increasingly less impulsive, controlled by the more effective disciplines put in place by churches and states, and capable of exercising greater self-control of his instincts. Two crucial forces, he argued, led to this transformation of the personality: the modern state and the market economy which developed in the big towns, such as London and Paris. On the one hand, the state claimed a monopoly of legal violence and demanded that behaviour be pacified, beginning with the noble warriors, who had to accept the refinement of etiquette and the obligations of a politeness which prohibited the overt expression of aggression. On the other, trade, then rapidly expanding, both led to and demanded a restriction of inter-personal violence; it could only prosper in conditions of freedom and security, said Enlightenment thinkers such as Adam Smith."

24:  Problems with the "Leviathan Theory" because decline in homicide is an independent variable of state centralization: "The weakness of this argument lies in the fact that the sharp decline in homicide is visible at the same time, in the first decades of the seventeenth century, in absolute states like Sweden and France and in states lacking centralized structures, such as the United Provinces and England. Nor can the growth of means of coercion really explain this phenomenon, as the Italian towns of the Renaissance, though equipped with large police forces, were unable to reduce significantly the high volume of everyday conflictuality."

24:  "It seems more pertinent to seek the cause in a higher level of acceptance by subjects of the legitimacy of the state, whatever its type."

25-6:  "The shift from the regulation of violence by families to a system controlled by states, and also churches, happened in the context of the growth of 'social discipline'.... The period is characterized by a spate of edicts designed to limit the occasions for sin, forbidding dissolute practices, dancing, attending many festivals and taverns during religious services, the abuse of alcoholic drinks, the carrying of weapons, etc. The supervision of behaviour, in particular of the excesses committed by young men, intensified in both Protestant and Catholic countries. Its effects were clearly neither immediate nor complete, because there was strong resistance in the rural world and among the poorer citizens. The children of good family, targeted by the pedagogues of both camps and subject to stricter moral surveillance, felt the effects at an early stage. They were not only educated in a new way, but given a new type of training in relational life, through the codes of politeness which developed the model of the 'perfect gentleman', for example in France from the 1630s."

25:  "In a world where every individual--and not just the nobles--had his own, honour was directly linked to sex, status and age. It also expressed collective values, in contrast to the cultures of personal guilt of a later date. Everyone was closely supervised by their fellows and lost status in the eyes of all if they did not behave in the correct way. The law of shame ruled this world, where the regard of others mattered much more than self-regard. This resulted in a very dense network of norms and requirements, characteristic of a society of proximity and reciprocal surveillance. If dishonour fell on an individual, it contaminated all the members of his 'clan', his close family, relatives, neighbours, friends--even the whole of a village or urban district if an aggressor from another parish could later boast of having humiliated those of the first. Murderous violence was simply a reflection of the intensity of the collective feelings which bound an individual to his group, to the point where vengeance became a sacred obligation, essential to the restoration of the collective honour that had been besmirched. Not only did the purity of women have to be defended as a supreme value by all the men, but the men had to avoid losing face in public if their manliness was challenged, if they were the subject of insults, threats or even jokes. To give way before an aggressor, to be beaten or defamed, was dishonourable not only for the one directly concerned, but for all his relatives, who would force him to respond even if he had no wish to."

25:  "In this context, violence was both legitimate and obligatory in order to escape shame."

26:  "This use of public humiliation to smooth away conflicts and allow the reintegration of the culprit into the community was slow to disappear."

26:  "The new severity of the courts, the invention of the police in the Paris of Louis XIV and the shocking example of the many young people hanged for theft on the gibbets of Tyburn, in London, all helped to accustom subjects to the heavy-handed protection of the state. It was integrated into a new culture of personal guilt, which left less space than before to the collective sense of honour and the law of shame."

29-30:  "Young males had to abandon the violence linked to the code of collective honour in favour of a culture of personal guilt defined by the moral pressure of the age; this was necessary in order to alter the repetitive mechanism by which property and founding principles were transmitted to the new generations, on a continent where 80 per cent of the population were peasants. Thus the West invented adolescence, a stage of life that was more clearly defined and more supervised, in order to impose everywhere the new dynamism of the states, churches and towns, including on the rural masses deeply attached to traditions of social fixity. The aim was not only to prevent young men from endangering the peace of the communities, but also to teach them a new approach to life, respect for it, and the obedience due to the institutions proclaiming themselves guardians of legitimate violence."

30:  "As the interior was pacified, the violence of the young males, beginning with the sons of good families, was partially reoriented towards the exterior...."
