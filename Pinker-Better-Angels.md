Preface
--

xxi:  "This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened in human history. Believe it or not--and I know that most people do not--violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence. The decline, to be sure, has not been smooth; it has not brought violence down to zero; and it is not guaranteed to continue. But it is an unmistakable development, visible on scales from millennia to years, from the waging of wars to the spanking of children."

xxi:  "How, in particular, are we to make sense of *modernity*--of the erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason, and science? So much depends on how we understand the legacy of this transition: whether we see our world as a nightmare of crime, terrorism, genocide, and war, or as a period that, by the standards of history, is blessed by unprecedented levels of peaceful coexistence."

xxii:  "By the standards of the mass atrocities of human history, the lethal injection of a murderer in Texas, or an occasional hate crime in which a member of an ethnic minority is intimidated by hooligans, is pretty mild stuff. But from a contemporary vantage point, we see them as signs of how low our behaviour can sink, not of how high our standards have risen."

	Okay, but is this the correct standard? Playing off a murder versus the Holocaust?

xxii:  "The problems I have set out to understand is the reduction in violence at many scales--in the family, in the neighbourhood, between tribes and other armed factions, and among major nations and states."

xxiii:  "My approach is scientific in the broad sense of seeking explanations for why things happen."

xxiii:  "Social scientists distinguish 'endogenous' variables--those that are inside the system, where they may be affected by the very phenomenon they are trying to explain--from the 'exogenous' ones--those that are set in motion by forces from the outside. Exogenous forces can originate in the practical realm, such as changes in technology, demographics, and the mechanisms of commerce and governance. But they can also originate in the intellectual realm, as new ideas are conceived and disseminated and take on a life of their own."

xxiv-xxv:  The (so-called) exogenous causes:

1. Pacification Process: agriculture, especially movement from hunter/gatherer to sedentary forms of organization;
2. Civilizing Process: state-formation, especially centralized states as opposed to feudal;
3. Humanitarian Revolution: organized efforts to abolish "social sanctioned forms of violence like despotism, slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, sadistic punishment, and cruelty to animals";
4. Long Peace: since end of WWII (1945) the "great states" have not been inclined to go to war with one another, including USSR/USA;
5. New Peace: since end of Cold War (1989), there have been fewer genocides, wars, civil wars, etc;
6. Rights Revolutions: since UDHR (1948), recognition of rights of minorities and prohibitions on violence against them.

xxv:  "Five Inner Demons"--neurological bases of violence:

1. Predatory/instrumental violence: "simply violence deployed as a practical means to an end";
2. Dominance: "the urge for authority, prestige, glory, and power";
3. Revenge: "moralistic urge toward retribution, punishment, and justice";
4. Sadism: "pleasure taken in another's suffering";
5. Ideology: "shared belief system, usually involving a vision of utopia, that justifies unlimited violence in pursuit of unlimited good."

xxv: "Four Better Angels"--neurological bases of peacefulness, cooperation, trust:

1. Empathy: "prompts us to feel the pain of others and to align their interests with our own";
2. Self-control: "anticipate the consequences of acting on our impulses and to inhibit them accordingly";
3. Moral sense: "sanctifies a set of norms and taboos that govern the interactions among people in a culture, sometimes in ways that decrease violence, though often (when the norms are tribal, authoritarian, or puritanical) in ways that increase it";
4. Reason: "allows us to extricate ourselves from our parochial vantage points, to reflect on the ways in which we live our lives, to deduce ways in which we could be better off, and to guide the application of the other better angels of our nature".

xxv-xxvi: "Five Historical Forces"--"exogenous forces that favour our peaceable motives and that have driven the multiple declines in violence":

1. Leviathan: "a state and judiciary with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, can defuse the temptation of exploitative attack, inhibit the impulse for revenge, and circumvent the self-serving biases that make all parties believe they are on the side of the angels";
2. Commerce: "a positive-sum game in which everybody can win";
3. Feminization: "process in which cultures have increasingly respected the interests and values of women";
4. Cosmopolitanism: "literacy, mobility, and mass media can prompt people to take the perspective of people unlike themselves and to expand their circle of sympathy to embrace them";
5. Escalator of reason: "intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to human affairs".

Chapter 1: A Foreign Country
--

1:  "If the past is a foreign country, it is a shockingly violent one. It is easy to forget how dangerous life used to be, how deeply brutality was once woven into the fabric of daily existence. Cultural memory pacifies the past, leaving us with pale souvenirs whose bloody origins have been bleached away."

6:  "The men's ingenuity, applied so resourcefully to weapons and strategy, turned up empty-handed when it came to the earthly causes of war. Rather than framing the scourge of warfare as a human problem for humans to solve, they concocted a fantasy of hotheaded gods and attributed their own tragedies to the gods' jealousies and follies."

7:  "For millennia readers have puzzled over why God insisted on this horrifying trial. One interpretation is that God intervened not because Abraham had passed the test but because he had failed it, but that is anachronistic: obedience to divine authority, not reverence for human life, was the cardinal virtue."

11:  "Whether or not the Israelites actually engaged in genocide, they certainly thought it was a good idea. The possibility that a woman had a legitimate interest in not being raped or acquired as sexual property did not seem to register in anyone's mind. The writers of the Bible saw nothing wrong with slavery or with cruel punishments like blinding, stoning, and hacking someone to pieces. Human life held no value in comparison with unthinking obedience to custom and authority."

13:  "Thought I like to think that nothing human is foreign to me, I find it impossible to put myself in the minds of the ancients who devised this orgy of sadism. Even if I had custody of Hitler and could mete out the desert of my choice, it would not occur to me to inflict a torture like that [crucifixion] on him. I could not avoid wincing in sympathy, would not want to become the kind of person who could indulge in such cruelty, and could see no point in adding to the world's reservoir of suffering without a commensurate benefit. (Even the practical goal of deterring future despots, I would reason, is better served by maximizing the expectation that they will be brought to justice than by maximizing the gruesomeness of the penalty.)"

	But: suffering of one/some is justified on the basis of benefit to greater number of others.

15:  "The voyeurism in the martyrologies was employed not to evoke outrage against torture but to inspire reverence for the bravery of the martyrs. As in the story of Jesus, torture was an excellent thing. The saints welcomed their torments, because suffering in this life would be rewarded with bliss in the next one."

16:  "As so often happens in the history of atrocity, later centuries would treat these horrors in lighthearted ways. In popular culture today witches not the victims of torture and execution but mischievous cartoon characters or sassy enchantresses, like Broom-Hilda, Witch Hazel, Glinda, Samantha, and the Halliwell sisters in *Charmed*."

	Not sure this makes the least bit of sense.
	
17:  "Once again, the point of this discussion is not to accuse Christians of endorsing torture and persecution. *Of course* most devout Christians today are thoroughly tolerant and humane people. Even those who thunder from televised pulpits do not call for burning heretics alive or hoisting Jews on the strappado. The question is why they don't, given that their beliefs imply that it would serve the greater good. The answer is that people in the West today compartmentalize their religious ideology. When they affirm their faith in houses of worship, they profess beliefs that have barely changed in two thousand years. But when it comes to their actions, they respect modern norms of nonviolence and toleration, a benevolent hypocrisy for which we should all be grateful."

23:  "The career of dueling showcases a puzzling phenomenon we will often encounter: a category of violence can be embedded in a civilization for centuries and then vanish into thin air. When gentlemen agreed to a duel, they were fighting not for money or land or even women but for honor, the strange commodity that exists because everyone believes that everyone else believes that it exists. Honor is a bubble that can be inflated by some parts of human nature, such as the drive for prestige and the entrenchment of norms, and popped by others, such as a sense of humor. The institution of formal dueling petered out in the English-speaking world by the middle of the 19th century, and in the rest of Europe in the following decades. Historians have noted that the institution was buried not so much by legal bans or moral disapproval as by ridicule."

23:  "But in the West today public places are no longer named after military victories. Our war memorials depict not proud commanders on horseback but weeping mothers, weary soldiers, or exhaustive lists of names of the dead. Military men are inconspicuous in public life, with drab uniforms and little prestige among the hoi polloi."

25:  "Another major change we have lived through is an intolerance of displays of force in everyday life. In earlier decades a man's willingness to use his fists in response to an insult was the sign of respectability. Today it is the sign of a boor, a symptom of impulse control disorder, a ticket to anger management therapy."

Chapter 2: The Pacification Process
---

31:  "Yet both men [Hobbes, Darwin] gave us insights about violence that are deeper, subtler, and ultimately more humane than their eponymous adjectives imply. Today any understanding of human violence must being with their analyses."

	*Any*, *must*?
	
32:  Referring to Dawkins's "survival machines," comments "In much of the living world, violence is simply the default, something that needs no further explanation."

	This is a rather dubious claim. Does it not raise the issue of *why* something is the default?
	
32-3:  "Any organism that has evolved to be violent is a member of a species whose other members, on average, have evolved to be just as violent. If you attack one of your own kind, your adversary may be as strong and pugnacious as you are, and armed with the same weapons and defenses. The likelihood that, in attacking a member of your own species, you will get hurt is a powerful selection pressure that disfavors indiscriminate pouncing or lashing out. It also rules out the hydraulic metaphor and most folk theories of violence, such as thirst for blood, a death wish, a killer instinct, and other destructive itches, urges, and impulses. When a tendency toward violence evolves, it is always *strategic*. Organisms are selected to deploy violence only in circumstances where the expected benefits outweigh the expected costs."

33:  "Hobbes considered competition to be an unavoidable consequence of agents' pursuing their interests."

34:  "How can intelligent agents extricate themselves from a Hobbesian trap? The most obvious way is through a policy of deterrence: Don't strike first; be strong enough to survive a first strike; and retaliate against any aggressor in kind."

34:  "Thus we have an explanation of the incentive to invade for trifles: a word, a smile, and any other sign of undervalue. Hobbes called it 'glory'; more commonly it is called 'honor'; the most accurate descriptor is 'credibility.'"

35:  "The logic of the Leviathan can be summed up in a triangle. In every act of violence, there are three interested parties: the aggressor, the victim, and a bystander. Each has a motive for violence: the aggressor to prey upon the victim, the victim to retaliate, the bystander to minimize collateral damage from their fight. Violence between combatants may be called war; violence by the bystander against the combatants may be called law. The Leviathan theory, in a nutshell, is that law is better than war."

37:  Regarding chimpanzee behaviour and what this can explain about primitive human behaviour: "And it tests the evolutionary prediction that violent tendencies are not hydraulic but strategic, deployed only in circumstances in which the potential gains are high and the risks are low."

38:  "All they [male chimps] care about is dominating their territory and eliminating rivals if they can do so with minimal risks to themselves. The evolutionary benefits [food, females] happen indirectly and over the long run."

	Okay, but how are long-run evolutionary benefits or detriments in any way related or determinate of present action? 
	
39:  "The idea that humans evolved from a peaceful, bonobolike ancestor has two problems. One is that it is easy to get carried away with the hippie-chimp story. [...] The second and more important problem is that the common ancestor of the two chimpanzee species and humans is far more likely to have been like a common chimpanzee than like a bonobo."

	Two problems with this. First, you can get carried away with hippie-chimp but not murder-chimp? This is dubious. Second, goalpost moving isn't especially helpful. Even if the most recent common ancestor was more murder-chimp-like, it remains the case that bonobos nonetheless descended from the ur-murder-chimp. If bonobos can, why not humans?
	
	Pinker explains that bonobos underwent neoteny; i.e., quasi-domestication. In other words, became chimp-civilized. Humans did not/could not?
	
41:  "When the first farmers settled down to grow grains and legumes and keep domesticated animals, their numbers exploded and they began to divide their labours, so that some of them lived off the food grown by others."

41-2:  "It took five thousand years after the origin of agriculture for true states to appear on the scene. That happened when the powerful chiefdoms used their armed retinues to bring other chiefdoms and tribes under their control, further centralizing their power and supporting niches for specialized classes of artisans and soldiers."

42:  "If we discover that violence has declined in a given people, it is because their mode of social organization has changed, not because the historical clock has struck a certain hour, and that change can happen at different times, if it happens at all."

42:  "The major transition we should expect is at the appearance of the first form of social organization that shows signs of design for reducing violence within its borders. That would the centralized state, the Leviathan."

43:  "Also, when bands of a few dozen men confront each other on a regular basis, even one or two deaths per battle can add up to a *rate* of casualties that is high by any standard."

44:  "Men in nonstate societies (and they are almost always men) are deadly serious about war, not just in their tactics but in their armaments, which include chemical, biological, and antipersonnel weapons."

46:  "Cannibalism may have been so common in prehistory as to have affected our evolution: our genomes contain genes that appear to be defenses against the prion diseases transmitted by cannibalism."

	Note: *appear*.
	
47:  "Only by looking at numbers can we get a sense as to whether civilization has increased violence or decreased it."

47:  "In absolute numbers, of course, civilized societies are matchless in the destruction they have wreaked. But should we look at absolute numbers, or at *relative* numbers, calculated as a proportion of the populations?"

47:  "The choice confronts us with the moral imponderable of whether it is worse for 50 percent of a population of one hundred to be killed or 1 percent of a population of one billion. In one frame of mind, one could say that a person who is tortured or killed suffers to the same degree regardless of how many other people meet such a fate, so it is the sum of these sufferings that should engage our sympathy and our analytic attention. But in another frame of mind, one could reason that part of the bargain of being alive is that one takes a chance at dying a premature or painful death, be it from violence, accident, or disease. So the number of people in a given time and place who enjoy full lives has to be counted as moral good, against which we calibrate the moral bad of the number who are victims of violence. Another way of expressing this frame of mind is to ask, 'If *I* were one of the people who were alive in a particular era, what would be the chances that I would be a victim of violence?' The reasoning in this second frame of mind, whether it appeals to the proportion of a population or the risk to an individual, ends in the conclusion that in comparing the harmfulness of violence across societies, we should focus on the rate, rather than the number, of violent acts."

	This is incoherent, even if the conclusion is correct--which is debatable.
	
	1. The inital choice is false. Qua violent death, it is equally a harm whether it is a population of 100 or a population of 1 billion. In either case, a given being is experience an act of violence that leads to death.
	2. The point about torture and suffering is poorly made. In a population of 100, what is called "torture" would most likely be found in the context of an initiatory rite. In other words, in that population of 100, torture would not be used as punishment or information gathering--as it would, in say, a population of 1 billion--and it would perform a positive integrative function that is recognize as such by both the tribe and the individuals. Torture in tiny tribal societies and in massive societies have different valences that cannot simply be erased in a silly "thought" "experiment." Nonetheless, it is clearly the case that it is worse for 10 million (1 percent of 1 billion) to suffer horribly than for 50 people, notwithstanding the fact that each individual suffers more or less the same. 
	3. "Part of the bargain..." If suffering is the only game in town, the issue isn't how to make the calculation (absolute vs. relative) but to (1) determine how suffering can be minimized and (2) consider the possibility that if suffering is the only game in town, that the game is rigged--hence, non-existence is preferable to existence.
	4. The hypothetical question is poorly posed in that it privileges the perspective of present ("I" reading this book in the early twenty-first century where violence has a negative valence and where it is rare) at the expense of the past. Ask the ultraviolent tribesman if he would give up his life in the jungle in favour of civilized life in the city and chances are that he'd laugh at the absurdity of the question.
	5. The conclusion does not follow. Rather, it begs the question.

50:  "They conservatively list about 40 million battle deaths during the 20th century. ('Battle deaths' refer to soldiers and civilians who were directly killed in combat.)"

	The use of direct is questionable: the extent to which contemporaries are dependent on infrastructure differs from that of non-contemporaries insofar as 20th century people tend to be dependent upon food they didn't grow, water from central sources, power, heat, and so on. Furthermore, it does not control for medical and surgical technologies. If the 20th century has a lower death rate than previous centuries with respect to war, it could be because infections can be controlled, wounds closed up, and the like. People who don't die now would have died in the past shortly after battle.
	
51:  "The economists Richard Steckel and John Wallis recently looked at data on nine hundred skeletons of Native Americans, distributed from southern Canada to South America, all of whom died before the arrival of Columbus. They divided the skeletons into hunter-gatherers and city dwellers, the latter from the civilizations in the Andes and Mesoamerica such as the Incas, Aztecs, and Mayans. The proportion of hunter-gatherers that showed signs of violent trauma was 13.4 percent, which is close to the average for the hunter-gathers in figure 2-2. The proportion of city dwellers that showed signs of violent trauma was 2.7 percent, which is close to the figures for the state societies before the present century. So holding many factors constant, we find that living in a civilization reduces one's chances of being a victim of violence fivefold."

51:  "Even the gentlest society will have the occasional young man who gets carried away in a barroom brawl or an old woman who puts arsenic in her husband's tea, so that is **pretty much as low as homicides ever go**." (Emphasis added.)

56:  "Though imperial conquest and rule can themselves be brutal, they do reduce endemic violence among the conquered."

57:  "Studies of skeletons by Steckel and his colleagues show that compared to hunter-gatherers, the first city dwellers were anemic, infected, tooth-decayed, and almost two and a half inches shorter."

57:  "A few cavities, the odd abscess, and a couple of inches in height were a small price to pay for a fivefold better chance of not getting speared."

	But, given the number of people who refused such a life even though they were aware of such lives suggests that it could lead to the opposite conclusion.
	
58:  "When it came to violence, then, the first Leviathans solved one problem but created another. People were less likely to become victims of homicide or casualties in war, but they were now under the thumbs of tyrants, clerics, and kleptocrats. This gives us the more sinister sense of the word *pacification*: not just the bringing about of peace but the imposition of absolute control by a coercive government. Solving this second problem would have to wait another few millennia, and in much of the world it remains unsolved to this day."
