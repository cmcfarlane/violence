Preface
--

xxi:  "This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened in human history. Believe it or not--and I know that most people do not--violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence. The decline, to be sure, has not been smooth; it has not brought violence down to zero; and it is not guaranteed to continue. But it is an unmistakable development, visible on scales from millennia to years, from the waging of wars to the spanking of children."

xxi:  "How, in particular, are we to make sense of *modernity*--of the erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason, and science? So much depends on how we understand the legacy of this transition: whether we see our world as a nightmare of crime, terrorism, genocide, and war, or as a period that, by the standards of history, is blessed by unprecedented levels of peaceful coexistence."

xxii:  "By the standards of the mass atrocities of human history, the lethal injection of a murderer in Texas, or an occasional hate crime in which a member of an ethnic minority is intimidated by hooligans, is pretty mild stuff. But from a contemporary vantage point, we see them as signs of how low our behaviour can sink, not of how high our standards have risen."

	Okay, but is this the correct standard? Playing off a murder versus the Holocaust?

xxii:  "The problems I have set out to understand is the reduction in violence at many scales--in the family, in the neighbourhood, between tribes and other armed factions, and among major nations and states."

xxiii:  "My approach is scientific in the broad sense of seeking explanations for why things happen."

xxiii:  "Social scientists distinguish 'endogenous' variables--those that are inside the system, where they may be affected by the very phenomenon they are trying to explain--from the 'exogenous' ones--those that are set in motion by forces from the outside. Exogenous forces can originate in the practical realm, such as changes in technology, demographics, and the mechanisms of commerce and governance. But they can also originate in the intellectual realm, as new ideas are conceived and disseminated and take on a life of their own."

xxiv-xxv:  The (so-called) exogenous causes:

1. Pacification Process: agriculture, especially movement from hunter/gatherer to sedentary forms of organization;
2. Civilizing Process: state-formation, especially centralized states as opposed to feudal;
3. Humanitarian Revolution: organized efforts to abolish "social sanctioned forms of violence like despotism, slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, sadistic punishment, and cruelty to animals";
4. Long Peace: since end of WWII (1945) the "great states" have not been inclined to go to war with one another, including USSR/USA;
5. New Peace: since end of Cold War (1989), there have been fewer genocides, wars, civil wars, etc;
6. Rights Revolutions: since UDHR (1948), recognition of rights of minorities and prohibitions on violence against them.

xxv:  "Five Inner Demons"--neurological bases of violence:

1. Predatory/instrumental violence: "simply violence deployed as a practical means to an end";
2. Dominance: "the urge for authority, prestige, glory, and power";
3. Revenge: "moralistic urge toward retribution, punishment, and justice";
4. Sadism: "pleasure taken in another's suffering";
5. Ideology: "shared belief system, usually involving a vision of utopia, that justifies unlimited violence in pursuit of unlimited good."

xxv: "Four Better Angels"--neurological bases of peacefulness, cooperation, trust:

1. Empathy: "prompts us to feel the pain of others and to align their interests with our own";
2. Self-control: "anticipate the consequences of acting on our impulses and to inhibit them accordingly";
3. Moral sense: "sanctifies a set of norms and taboos that govern the interactions among people in a culture, sometimes in ways that decrease violence, though often (when the norms are tribal, authoritarian, or puritanical) in ways that increase it";
4. Reason: "allows us to extricate ourselves from our parochial vantage points, to reflect on the ways in which we live our lives, to deduce ways in which we could be better off, and to guide the application of the other better angels of our nature".

xxv-xxvi: "Five Historical Forces"--"exogenous forces that favour our peaceable motives and that have driven the multiple declines in violence":

1. Leviathan: "a state and judiciary with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, can defuse the temptation of exploitative attack, inhibit the impulse for revenge, and circumvent the self-serving biases that make all parties believe they are on the side of the angels";
2. Commerce: "a positive-sum game in which everybody can win";
3. Feminization: "process in which cultures have increasingly respected the interests and values of women";
4. Cosmopolitanism: "literacy, mobility, and mass media can prompt people to take the perspective of people unlike themselves and to expand their circle of sympathy to embrace them";
5. Escalator of reason: "intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to human affairs".



Chapter 1: A Foreign Country
--

1:  "If the past is a foreign country, it is a shockingly violent one. It is easy to forget how dangerous life used to be, how deeply brutality was once woven into the fabric of daily existence. Cultural memory pacifies the past, leaving us with pale souvenirs whose bloody origins have been bleached away."

6:  "The men's ingenuity, applied so resourcefully to weapons and strategy, turned up empty-handed when it came to the earthly causes of war. Rather than framing the scourge of warfare as a human problem for humans to solve, they concocted a fantasy of hotheaded gods and attributed their own tragedies to the gods' jealousies and follies."

7:  "For millennia readers have puzzled over why God insisted on this horrifying trial. One interpretation is that God intervened not because Abraham had passed the test but because he had failed it, but that is anachronistic: obedience to divine authority, not reverence for human life, was the cardinal virtue."

11:  "Whether or not the Israelites actually engaged in genocide, they certainly thought it was a good idea. The possibility that a woman had a legitimate interest in not being raped or acquired as sexual property did not seem to register in anyone's mind. The writers of the Bible saw nothing wrong with slavery or with cruel punishments like blinding, stoning, and hacking someone to pieces. Human life held no value in comparison with unthinking obedience to custom and authority."

13:  "Thought I like to think that nothing human is foreign to me, I find it impossible to put myself in the minds of the ancients who devised this orgy of sadism. Even if I had custody of Hitler and could mete out the desert of my choice, it would not occur to me to inflict a torture like that [crucifixion] on him. I could not avoid wincing in sympathy, would not want to become the kind of person who could indulge in such cruelty, and could see no point in adding to the world's reservoir of suffering without a commensurate benefit. (Even the practical goal of deterring future despots, I would reason, is better served by maximizing the expectation that they will be brought to justice than by maximizing the gruesomeness of the penalty.)"

	But: suffering of one/some is justified on the basis of benefit to greater number of others.

15:  "The voyeurism in the martyrologies was employed not to evoke outrage against torture but to inspire reverence for the bravery of the martyrs. As in the story of Jesus, torture was an excellent thing. The saints welcomed their torments, because suffering in this life would be rewarded with bliss in the next one."

16:  "As so often happens in the history of atrocity, later centuries would treat these horrors in lighthearted ways. In popular culture today witches not the victims of torture and execution but mischievous cartoon characters or sassy enchantresses, like Broom-Hilda, Witch Hazel, Glinda, Samantha, and the Halliwell sisters in *Charmed*."

	Not sure this makes the least bit of sense.
	
17:  "Once again, the point of this discussion is not to accuse Christians of endorsing torture and persecution. *Of course* most devout Christians today are thoroughly tolerant and humane people. Even those who thunder from televised pulpits do not call for burning heretics alive or hoisting Jews on the strappado. The question is why they don't, given that their beliefs imply that it would serve the greater good. The answer is that people in the West today compartmentalize their religious ideology. When they affirm their faith in houses of worship, they profess beliefs that have barely changed in two thousand years. But when it comes to their actions, they respect modern norms of nonviolence and toleration, a benevolent hypocrisy for which we should all be grateful."

23:  "The career of dueling showcases a puzzling phenomenon we will often encounter: a category of violence can be embedded in a civilization for centuries and then vanish into thin air. When gentlemen agreed to a duel, they were fighting not for money or land or even women but for honor, the strange commodity that exists because everyone believes that everyone else believes that it exists. Honor is a bubble that can be inflated by some parts of human nature, such as the drive for prestige and the entrenchment of norms, and popped b others, such as a sense of humor. The institution of formal dueling petered out in the English-speaking world by the middle of the 19th century, and in the rest of Europe in the following decades. Historians have noted that the institution was buried not so much by legal bans or moral disapproval as by ridicule."

23:  "But in the West today public places are no longer named after military victories. Our war memorials depict not proud commanders on horseback but weeping mothers, weary soldiers, or exhaustive lists of names of the dead. Military men are inconspicuous in public life, with drab uniforms and little prestige among the hoi polloi."

25:  "Another major change we have lived through is an intolerance of displays of force in everyday life. In earlier decades a man's willingness to use his fists in response to an insult was the sign of respectability. Today it is the sign of a boor, a symptom of impulse control disorder, a ticket to anger management therapy."
