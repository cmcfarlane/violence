Pinker, Steven. *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*. New York: Viking, 2011.
==

One wonders if Pinker's utopia would be a strong centralized state, para-militarized police footpatrolling in neighbourhoods, heavy-handed enforcement of minor offences of the poor (graffiti, theft, loitering, homelessness) [123], incarceration to the point of diminishing returns [121-3], strict population control in the developing world (especially global south), equally strict population control in North American and European societies for the poor, but no population control if you meet a property and decency qualification, and otherwise free markets.

Preface
--

xxi:  "This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened in human history. Believe it or not--and I know that most people do not--violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence. The decline, to be sure, has not been smooth; it has not brought violence down to zero; and it is not guaranteed to continue. But it is an unmistakable development, visible on scales from millennia to years, from the waging of wars to the spanking of children."

xxi:  "How, in particular, are we to make sense of *modernity*--of the erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason, and science? So much depends on how we understand the legacy of this transition: whether we see our world as a nightmare of crime, terrorism, genocide, and war, or as a period that, by the standards of history, is blessed by unprecedented levels of peaceful coexistence."

xxii:  "By the standards of the mass atrocities of human history, the lethal injection of a murderer in Texas, or an occasional hate crime in which a member of an ethnic minority is intimidated by hooligans, is pretty mild stuff. But from a contemporary vantage point, we see them as signs of how low our behaviour can sink, not of how high our standards have risen."

Okay, but is this the correct standard? Playing off a murder versus the Holocaust?

xxii:  "The problems I have set out to understand is the reduction in violence at many scales--in the family, in the neighbourhood, between tribes and other armed factions, and among major nations and states."

xxiii:  "My approach is scientific in the broad sense of seeking explanations for why things happen."

xxiii:  "Social scientists distinguish 'endogenous' variables--those that are inside the system, where they may be affected by the very phenomenon they are trying to explain--from the 'exogenous' ones--those that are set in motion by forces from the outside. Exogenous forces can originate in the practical realm, such as changes in technology, demographics, and the mechanisms of commerce and governance. But they can also originate in the intellectual realm, as new ideas are conceived and disseminated and take on a life of their own."

xxiv-xxv:  The (so-called) exogenous causes:

1. Pacification Process: agriculture, especially movement from hunter/gatherer to sedentary forms of organization;
2. Civilizing Process: state-formation, especially centralized states as opposed to feudal;
3. Humanitarian Revolution: organized efforts to abolish "social sanctioned forms of violence like despotism, slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, sadistic punishment, and cruelty to animals";
4. Long Peace: since end of WWII (1945) the "great states" have not been inclined to go to war with one another, including USSR/USA;
5. New Peace: since end of Cold War (1989), there have been fewer genocides, wars, civil wars, etc;
6. Rights Revolutions: since UDHR (1948), recognition of rights of minorities and prohibitions on violence against them.

xxv:  "Five Inner Demons"--neurological bases of violence:

1. Predatory/instrumental violence: "simply violence deployed as a practical means to an end";
2. Dominance: "the urge for authority, prestige, glory, and power";
3. Revenge: "moralistic urge toward retribution, punishment, and justice";
4. Sadism: "pleasure taken in another's suffering";
5. Ideology: "shared belief system, usually involving a vision of utopia, that justifies unlimited violence in pursuit of unlimited good."

xxv: "Four Better Angels"--neurological bases of peacefulness, cooperation, trust:

1. Empathy: "prompts us to feel the pain of others and to align their interests with our own";
2. Self-control: "anticipate the consequences of acting on our impulses and to inhibit them accordingly";
3. Moral sense: "sanctifies a set of norms and taboos that govern the interactions among people in a culture, sometimes in ways that decrease violence, though often (when the norms are tribal, authoritarian, or puritanical) in ways that increase it";
4. Reason: "allows us to extricate ourselves from our parochial vantage points, to reflect on the ways in which we live our lives, to deduce ways in which we could be better off, and to guide the application of the other better angels of our nature".

xxv-xxvi: "Five Historical Forces"--"exogenous forces that favour our peaceable motives and that have driven the multiple declines in violence":

1. Leviathan: "a state and judiciary with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, can defuse the temptation of exploitative attack, inhibit the impulse for revenge, and circumvent the self-serving biases that make all parties believe they are on the side of the angels";
2. Commerce: "a positive-sum game in which everybody can win";
3. Feminization: "process in which cultures have increasingly respected the interests and values of women";
4. Cosmopolitanism: "literacy, mobility, and mass media can prompt people to take the perspective of people unlike themselves and to expand their circle of sympathy to embrace them";
5. Escalator of reason: "intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to human affairs".

Chapter 1: A Foreign Country
--

1:  "If the past is a foreign country, it is a shockingly violent one. It is easy to forget how dangerous life used to be, how deeply brutality was once woven into the fabric of daily existence. Cultural memory pacifies the past, leaving us with pale souvenirs whose bloody origins have been bleached away."

6:  "The men's ingenuity, applied so resourcefully to weapons and strategy, turned up empty-handed when it came to the earthly causes of war. Rather than framing the scourge of warfare as a human problem for humans to solve, they concocted a fantasy of hotheaded gods and attributed their own tragedies to the gods' jealousies and follies."

7:  "For millennia readers have puzzled over why God insisted on this horrifying trial. One interpretation is that God intervened not because Abraham had passed the test but because he had failed it, but that is anachronistic: obedience to divine authority, not reverence for human life, was the cardinal virtue."

11:  "Whether or not the Israelites actually engaged in genocide, they certainly thought it was a good idea. The possibility that a woman had a legitimate interest in not being raped or acquired as sexual property did not seem to register in anyone's mind. The writers of the Bible saw nothing wrong with slavery or with cruel punishments like blinding, stoning, and hacking someone to pieces. Human life held no value in comparison with unthinking obedience to custom and authority."

13:  "Thought I like to think that nothing human is foreign to me, I find it impossible to put myself in the minds of the ancients who devised this orgy of sadism. Even if I had custody of Hitler and could mete out the desert of my choice, it would not occur to me to inflict a torture like that [crucifixion] on him. I could not avoid wincing in sympathy, would not want to become the kind of person who could indulge in such cruelty, and could see no point in adding to the world's reservoir of suffering without a commensurate benefit. (Even the practical goal of deterring future despots, I would reason, is better served by maximizing the expectation that they will be brought to justice than by maximizing the gruesomeness of the penalty.)"

But: suffering of one/some is justified on the basis of benefit to greater number of others.

15:  "The voyeurism in the martyrologies was employed not to evoke outrage against torture but to inspire reverence for the bravery of the martyrs. As in the story of Jesus, torture was an excellent thing. The saints welcomed their torments, because suffering in this life would be rewarded with bliss in the next one."

16:  "As so often happens in the history of atrocity, later centuries would treat these horrors in lighthearted ways. In popular culture today witches not the victims of torture and execution but mischievous cartoon characters or sassy enchantresses, like Broom-Hilda, Witch Hazel, Glinda, Samantha, and the Halliwell sisters in *Charmed*."

Not sure this makes the least bit of sense.
	
17:  "Once again, the point of this discussion is not to accuse Christians of endorsing torture and persecution. *Of course* most devout Christians today are thoroughly tolerant and humane people. Even those who thunder from televised pulpits do not call for burning heretics alive or hoisting Jews on the strappado. The question is why they don't, given that their beliefs imply that it would serve the greater good. The answer is that people in the West today compartmentalize their religious ideology. When they affirm their faith in houses of worship, they profess beliefs that have barely changed in two thousand years. But when it comes to their actions, they respect modern norms of nonviolence and toleration, a benevolent hypocrisy for which we should all be grateful."

23:  "The career of dueling showcases a puzzling phenomenon we will often encounter: a category of violence can be embedded in a civilization for centuries and then vanish into thin air. When gentlemen agreed to a duel, they were fighting not for money or land or even women but for honor, the strange commodity that exists because everyone believes that everyone else believes that it exists. Honor is a bubble that can be inflated by some parts of human nature, such as the drive for prestige and the entrenchment of norms, and popped by others, such as a sense of humor. The institution of formal dueling petered out in the English-speaking world by the middle of the 19th century, and in the rest of Europe in the following decades. Historians have noted that the institution was buried not so much by legal bans or moral disapproval as by ridicule."

23:  "But in the West today public places are no longer named after military victories. Our war memorials depict not proud commanders on horseback but weeping mothers, weary soldiers, or exhaustive lists of names of the dead. Military men are inconspicuous in public life, with drab uniforms and little prestige among the hoi polloi."

25:  "Another major change we have lived through is an intolerance of displays of force in everyday life. In earlier decades a man's willingness to use his fists in response to an insult was the sign of respectability. Today it is the sign of a boor, a symptom of impulse control disorder, a ticket to anger management therapy."

Chapter 2: The Pacification Process
---

31:  "Yet both men [Hobbes, Darwin] gave us insights about violence that are deeper, subtler, and ultimately more humane than their eponymous adjectives imply. Today any understanding of human violence must being with their analyses."

*Any*, *must*?
	
32:  Referring to Dawkins's "survival machines," comments "In much of the living world, violence is simply the default, something that needs no further explanation."

This is a rather dubious claim. Does it not raise the issue of *why* something is the default?
	
32-3:  "Any organism that has evolved to be violent is a member of a species whose other members, on average, have evolved to be just as violent. If you attack one of your own kind, your adversary may be as strong and pugnacious as you are, and armed with the same weapons and defenses. The likelihood that, in attacking a member of your own species, you will get hurt is a powerful selection pressure that disfavors indiscriminate pouncing or lashing out. It also rules out the hydraulic metaphor and most folk theories of violence, such as thirst for blood, a death wish, a killer instinct, and other destructive itches, urges, and impulses. When a tendency toward violence evolves, it is always *strategic*. Organisms are selected to deploy violence only in circumstances where the expected benefits outweigh the expected costs."

33:  "Hobbes considered competition to be an unavoidable consequence of agents' pursuing their interests."

34:  "How can intelligent agents extricate themselves from a Hobbesian trap? The most obvious way is through a policy of deterrence: Don't strike first; be strong enough to survive a first strike; and retaliate against any aggressor in kind."

34:  "Thus we have an explanation of the incentive to invade for trifles: a word, a smile, and any other sign of undervalue. Hobbes called it 'glory'; more commonly it is called 'honor'; the most accurate descriptor is 'credibility.'"

35:  "The logic of the Leviathan can be summed up in a triangle. In every act of violence, there are three interested parties: the aggressor, the victim, and a bystander. Each has a motive for violence: the aggressor to prey upon the victim, the victim to retaliate, the bystander to minimize collateral damage from their fight. Violence between combatants may be called war; violence by the bystander against the combatants may be called law. The Leviathan theory, in a nutshell, is that law is better than war."

37:  Regarding chimpanzee behaviour and what this can explain about primitive human behaviour: "And it tests the evolutionary prediction that violent tendencies are not hydraulic but strategic, deployed only in circumstances in which the potential gains are high and the risks are low."

38:  "All they [male chimps] care about is dominating their territory and eliminating rivals if they can do so with minimal risks to themselves. The evolutionary benefits [food, females] happen indirectly and over the long run."

Okay, but how are long-run evolutionary benefits or detriments in any way related or determinate of present action? 
	
39:  "The idea that humans evolved from a peaceful, bonobolike ancestor has two problems. One is that it is easy to get carried away with the hippie-chimp story. [...] The second and more important problem is that the common ancestor of the two chimpanzee species and humans is far more likely to have been like a common chimpanzee than like a bonobo."

Two problems with this. First, you can get carried away with hippie-chimp but not murder-chimp? This is dubious. Second, goalpost moving isn't especially helpful. Even if the most recent common ancestor was more murder-chimp-like, it remains the case that bonobos nonetheless descended from the ur-murder-chimp. If bonobos can, why not humans?
	
Pinker explains that bonobos underwent neoteny; i.e., quasi-domestication. In other words, became chimp-civilized. Humans did not/could not?
	
41:  "When the first farmers settled down to grow grains and legumes and keep domesticated animals, their numbers exploded and they began to divide their labours, so that some of them lived off the food grown by others."

41-2:  "It took five thousand years after the origin of agriculture for true states to appear on the scene. That happened when the powerful chiefdoms used their armed retinues to bring other chiefdoms and tribes under their control, further centralizing their power and supporting niches for specialized classes of artisans and soldiers."

42:  "If we discover that violence has declined in a given people, it is because their mode of social organization has changed, not because the historical clock has struck a certain hour, and that change can happen at different times, if it happens at all."

42:  "The major transition we should expect is at the appearance of the first form of social organization that shows signs of design for reducing violence within its borders. That would the centralized state, the Leviathan."

43:  "Also, when bands of a few dozen men confront each other on a regular basis, even one or two deaths per battle can add up to a *rate* of casualties that is high by any standard."

44:  "Men in nonstate societies (and they are almost always men) are deadly serious about war, not just in their tactics but in their armaments, which include chemical, biological, and antipersonnel weapons."

46:  "Cannibalism may have been so common in prehistory as to have affected our evolution: our genomes contain genes that appear to be defenses against the prion diseases transmitted by cannibalism."

	Note: *appear*.
	
47:  "Only by looking at numbers can we get a sense as to whether civilization has increased violence or decreased it."

47:  "In absolute numbers, of course, civilized societies are matchless in the destruction they have wreaked. But should we look at absolute numbers, or at *relative* numbers, calculated as a proportion of the populations?"

47:  "The choice confronts us with the moral imponderable of whether it is worse for 50 percent of a population of one hundred to be killed or 1 percent of a population of one billion. In one frame of mind, one could say that a person who is tortured or killed suffers to the same degree regardless of how many other people meet such a fate, so it is the sum of these sufferings that should engage our sympathy and our analytic attention. But in another frame of mind, one could reason that part of the bargain of being alive is that one takes a chance at dying a premature or painful death, be it from violence, accident, or disease. So the number of people in a given time and place who enjoy full lives has to be counted as moral good, against which we calibrate the moral bad of the number who are victims of violence. Another way of expressing this frame of mind is to ask, 'If *I* were one of the people who were alive in a particular era, what would be the chances that I would be a victim of violence?' The reasoning in this second frame of mind, whether it appeals to the proportion of a population or the risk to an individual, ends in the conclusion that in comparing the harmfulness of violence across societies, we should focus on the rate, rather than the number, of violent acts."

This is incoherent, even if the conclusion is correct--which is debatable.
	
1. The inital choice is false. Qua violent death, it is equally a harm whether it is a population of 100 or a population of 1 billion. In either case, a given being is experience an act of violence that leads to death.
2. The point about torture and suffering is poorly made. In a population of 100, what is called "torture" would most likely be found in the context of an initiatory rite. In other words, in that population of 100, torture would not be used as punishment or information gathering--as it would, in say, a population of 1 billion--and it would perform a positive integrative function that is recognize as such by both the tribe and the individuals. Torture in tiny tribal societies and in massive societies have different valences that cannot simply be erased in a silly "thought" "experiment." Nonetheless, it is clearly the case that it is worse for 10 million (1 percent of 1 billion) to suffer horribly than for 50 people, notwithstanding the fact that each individual suffers more or less the same. 
3. "Part of the bargain..." If suffering is the only game in town, the issue isn't how to make the calculation (absolute vs. relative) but to (1) determine how suffering can be minimized and (2) consider the possibility that if suffering is the only game in town, that the game is rigged--hence, non-existence is preferable to existence.
4. The hypothetical question is poorly posed in that it privileges the perspective of present ("I" reading this book in the early twenty-first century where violence has a negative valence and where it is rare) at the expense of the past. Ask the ultraviolent tribesman if he would give up his life in the jungle in favour of civilized life in the city and chances are that he'd laugh at the absurdity of the question.
5. The conclusion does not follow. Rather, it begs the question.

50:  "They conservatively list about 40 million battle deaths during the 20th century. ('Battle deaths' refer to soldiers and civilians who were directly killed in combat.)"

The use of direct is questionable: the extent to which contemporaries are dependent on infrastructure differs from that of non-contemporaries insofar as 20th century people tend to be dependent upon food they didn't grow, water from central sources, power, heat, and so on. Furthermore, it does not control for medical and surgical technologies. If the 20th century has a lower death rate than previous centuries with respect to war, it could be because infections can be controlled, wounds closed up, and the like. People who don't die now would have died in the past shortly after battle.
	
51:  "The economists Richard Steckel and John Wallis recently looked at data on nine hundred skeletons of Native Americans, distributed from southern Canada to South America, all of whom died before the arrival of Columbus. They divided the skeletons into hunter-gatherers and city dwellers, the latter from the civilizations in the Andes and Mesoamerica such as the Incas, Aztecs, and Mayans. The proportion of hunter-gatherers that showed signs of violent trauma was 13.4 percent, which is close to the average for the hunter-gathers in figure 2-2. The proportion of city dwellers that showed signs of violent trauma was 2.7 percent, which is close to the figures for the state societies before the present century. So holding many factors constant, we find that living in a civilization reduces one's chances of being a victim of violence fivefold."

51:  "Even the gentlest society will have the occasional young man who gets carried away in a barroom brawl or an old woman who puts arsenic in her husband's tea, so that is **pretty much as low as homicides ever go**." (Emphasis added.)

56:  "Though imperial conquest and rule can themselves be brutal, they do reduce endemic violence among the conquered."

57:  "Studies of skeletons by Steckel and his colleagues show that compared to hunter-gatherers, the first city dwellers were anemic, infected, tooth-decayed, and almost two and a half inches shorter."

57:  "A few cavities, the odd abscess, and a couple of inches in height were a small price to pay for a fivefold better chance of not getting speared."

But, given the number of people who refused such a life even though they were aware of such lives suggests that it could lead to the opposite conclusion.
	
58:  "When it came to violence, then, the first Leviathans solved one problem but created another. People were less likely to become victims of homicide or casualties in war, but they were now under the thumbs of tyrants, clerics, and kleptocrats. This gives us the more sinister sense of the word *pacification*: not just the bringing about of peace but the imposition of absolute control by a coercive government. Solving this second problem would have to wait another few millennia, and in much of the world it remains unsolved to this day."

Chapter 3: The Civilizing Process
---

62:  "Homicide is the crime of choice for measures of violence because regardless of how the people of a distant culture conceptualize crime, a dead body is hard to define away, and it always arouses curiosity about who or what produced it. Records of homicide are therefore a more reliable index of violence than records of robbery, rape, or assault, and they are usually (though not always) correlate with them."

62:  "Eisner cites studies showing that when people today are presented with the circumstances of a centuries-old murder and asked whether they think it was intentional, they usually come to the same conclusion as did the people at the time."

Assuming Eisner is correct, the relevance isn't entirely clear and this is an important point. Even if both groups agree that it was intentional, this does not make it a crime. After all, a number of intentional homicides are excused in the present. The range of excusable homicides in the past was greater. And, indeed, the distinction between intentional and non-intentional homicide had to be constructed. The relevance of this doesn't relate to the body count, but to how the body count was understood, which is significant. This is a point that Pinker repeatedly ignores: violence could have a positive valence or, at least, be accepted as unescapable.
	
Citing Eisner, "Long-Term Historical Trends in Violent Crime," Crime & Justice 30 (2003): 83-142.
	
63:  "While Europe was becoming less murderous overall, certain patterns in homicide remained constant. Men were responsible for about 92 percent of the killings (other than infanticide), and they were most likely to kill when they were in their twenties. Untile the 1960s uptick, cities were generally safer than the countryside. But other patterns changed. In the earlier centuries the upper and lower social classes engaged in homicide at comparable rates. But as the homicide rate fell, it dropped far more precipitously among the upper classes than among the lower ones [...]"

64:  "As Europe became more urban, cosmopolitan, commercial, industrialized, and secular, it got safer and safer."

67:  Elias: "the little people, too--the hatters, the tailors, the shepherds--were all quick to draw their knives."

71:  "The only explicit rationales stated in the etiquette books are to avoid acting like a peasant or an animal and to avoid offending others."

72:  "He [Elias] proposed that over a span of several centuries, beginning in the 11th or 12th and maturing in the 17th and 18th, Europeans increasingly inhibited their impulses, anticipated the long-term consequences of their actions, and took other people's thoughts and feelings into consideration."

73-4:  "At this point in the story, the theory of the Civilizing Process is incomplete, because it appeals to a process that is endogenous to the phenomenon it is trying to explain. A decline in violent behavior, it says, coincided with a decline in impulsiveness, honor, sexual license, incivility, and boorishness at the dinner table. But this just entangles us in a web of psychological processes. It hardly counts as an explanation to say that people behaved less violently because they learned to inhibit their violent impulses. Nor can we feel confident that people's impulsiveness changed first and that a reduction in violence was the result, rather than the other way around."

Pinker claims that Elias gives two exogenous factors.

74:  "The first was the consolidation of a genuine Leviathan after centuries of anarchy in Europe's feudal patchwork of baronies and fiefs. Centralized monarchies gained in strength, brought the warring knights under their control, and extended their tentacles into the outer reaches of their kingdoms."

75:  "The second exogenous change during the later Middle Ages was an economic revolution. The economic base of the feudal system was land and the peasants who worked it. As real estate agents like to say, land is the one thing they can't make more of. In an economy based on land, if someone wants to improve his standard of living, or for that matter maintain it during a Malthusian population expansion, his primary option is to conquer the neighboring lot. In the language of game theory, competition for land is zero-sum: one player's gain is another player's loss."

76-7:  "Positive-sum games also change the incentives for violence. If you're trading favors or surpluses with someone, your trading partner suddenly becomes more valuable to you alive than dead. You have an incentive, moreover, to anticipate what he wants, the better to supply it to him in exchange for what you want. Though many intellectuals, following in the footsteps of Saints Augustine and Jerome, hold businesspeople in contempt for their selfishness and greed, in fact a free market puts a premium on empathy. A good businessperson has to keep the customers satisfied or a competitor will woo them away, and the more customers he attracts, the richer he will be."

77:  "And this brings us to the second exogenous change. Elias noted that in the late Middle Ages people began to unmire themselves from technological and economic stagnation. Money increasingly replaced barter, aided by the larger national territories in which a currency could be recognized. The building of roads, neglected since Roman times, resumed, allowing the transport of goods to the hinterlands of the country and not just along its coasts and navigable rivers. Horse transport became more efficient with the use of horseshoes that protected hooves from paving stones and yokes that didn't choke the poor horse when it pulled a heavy load. Wheeled carts, compasses, clocks, spinning wheels, treadle looms, windmills, and water mills were also perfected in the later Middle Ages. And the specialized expertise needed to implement these technologies was cultivated in an expanding stratum of craftsmen. The advances encouraged the division of labor, increased surpluses, and lubricated the machinery of exchange. Life presented people with more positive-sum games and reduced the attractiveness of zero-sum plunder. To take advantage of the opportunities, people had to plan for the future, control their impulses, take other people's perspectives, and exercise the other social and cognitive skills needed to proses in social networks."

77:  "The positive-sum cooperation of commerce flourishes best inside a big tent presided over by a Leviathan."

79:  "the decline of violence in Europe and the rise of centralized states did not always proceed in lockstep."

81:  "Two of these rule-proving exceptions are zones that the Civilizing Process never fully penetrated: the lower strata of the socioeconomic scale, and the inaccessible or inhospitable territories of the globe. And two are zones in which the Civilizing Process went into reverse: the developing world, and the 1960s."

82:  "The European decline of violence was spearheaded by a decline in *elite* violence. Today statistics from every Western country show that the overwhelming majority of homicides and violent crimes are committed by people in the lowest socioeconomic classes."

83:  "The main reason that violence correlates with low socioeconomic status today is that the elites and the middle class pursue justice with the legal system while the lower classes resort to what scholars of violence call 'self-help.'"

Citing/discussing Donald Black, "Crime as Social Control" where in many cases crime is vengeance/justice.
	
83:  "Most homicides, Black notes, are really instances of capital punishment, with a private citizen as the judge, jury, and executioner."

84:  "These observations overturn many dogmas about violence. One is that violence is caused by a deficit of morality and justice. On the contrary, violence is often caused by a surfeit of morality and justice, at least as they are conceived in the minds of the perpetrators. Another dogma, cherished among psychologists and public health researchers, is that violence is kind of a disease. But this public health theory of violence flouts the basic definition of a disease, namely a malfunction that causes suffering to the individual. Most violent people insist there is nothing wrong with them; it's the victim and the bystanders who think there's a problem. A third dubious belief about violence is that lower-class people engage in it because they are financially needy (for example, stealing food to feed their children) or because they are expressing rage against society. The violence of a lower-class man may indeed express rage, but it is aimed not at society but at the asshole who scraped his car and dissed him in front of a crowd."

85:  "The historical Civilizing Process, in other words, did not eliminate violence, but it did relegate it to the socioeconomic margins."

85:  "The Civilizing Process spread not only downward along the socioeconomic scale but outward across the geographical scale, from a Western European epicenter."

87:  "The good news is that the media national homicide rate among the world's countries in this dataset is 6 per 100,000 per year. The overall homicide rate for the entire world, ignoring the division into countries, was estimated by the WHO in 2000 as 8.8 per 100,000 per year. Both estimates compare favourably to the triple-digit values for pre-state societies and the double-digit values for medieval Europe."

89:  "the relationship between crime and democratization is an inverted U. Established democracies are relatively safe places, as are established autocracies, but emerging democracies and semi-democracies (also called anocracies) are often plagued by violent crime and vulnerable to civil war, which sometimes shade into each other."

90:  "Every human society is faced with a conflict of interest between the younger men, who seek dominance (and ultimately mating opportunities) for themselves, and the older men, who seek to minimize internecine damage within their extended families and clans."

91:  "In short, the governance vacuum left by instant decolonization put the Papuans through a decivilizing process that left them [the Enga] with neither traditional norms nor modern third-party enforcement. Similar degenerations have occurred in other former colonies in the developing world, forming eddies in the global flow toward lower rates of homicide."

92:  "It's not just that America is gun-happy. Even if you subtract all the killings with firearms and count only the ones with rope, knives, lead pipes, wrenches, candlesticks, and so on, Americans commit murders at a higher rate than Europeans."

94:  "These jurisdictions [Louisiana, DC] are outliers mainly because they have a high proportion of African Americans. The current black-white difference in homicide rates within the United States is stark. Between 1976 and 2005 the average homicide rate for white Americans was 4.8, while the average rate for black Americans was 36.9."

94:  "Southern whites are more violent than northern whites, and southern blacks are more violent than northern blacks."

95-6:  "The Dutch colony of New Netherland, with its settlements from Connecticut to Delaware, saw a sharp decline in its early decades, from 68 to 15 per 100,000. But when the data resume in the 19th century, we start to see the United States diverging from the two mother countries. Though the more rural and ethnically homogeneous parts of New England (Vermont and New Hampshire) continue to hover in the peaceful basement beneath 1 in 100,000, the city of Boston became more violent in the middle of the 19th century, overlapping cities in former New Netherland such as New York and Philadelphia."

99:  "In Europe, first the state disarmed the people and claimed a monopoly on violence, then the people took over the the apparatus of the state. In America, the people took over the state before it had forced them to lay down their arms--which, as the Second Amendment famously affirms, they reserve the right to keep and bear. In other words Americans, and especially Americans in the South and West, never fully signed on to a social contract that would vest the government with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. In much of American history, legitimate force was also wielded by posses, vigilantes, lynch mobs, company police, detective agencies, and Pinkertons, and even more often kept as a prerogative of the individual."

99-100:  "Self-help justice depends on the credibility of one's prowess and resolve, and to this day the American South is marked by an obsession with credible deterrence, otherwise known as a culture of honor. The essence of a culture of honor is that it does not sanction predatory or instrumental violence, but only retaliation after an insult or other mistreatment. [...] In surveys, southerners do not endorse the use of violence in the abstract, but only to protect home and family. The laws of the southern states sanction this morality. They give a person wide latitude to kill in defense of self or property, put fewer restrictions on gun purchases, allow corporal punishment ('paddling') in schools, and specify the death penalty for murder, which their judicial systems are happy to carry out. Southern men and women are more likely to serve in the military, to study at military academies, and to take hawkish positions on foreign policy."

102:  "The immediate trigger for self-help justice, then, is anarchy, not herding itself."

104-5:  "The one great universal in the study of violence is that most of it is committed by fifteen-to-thirty-year-old-men. Not only are males the more competitive sex in most mammalian species, but with *Homo sapiens* a man's position in the pecking order is secured by reputation, an investment with a lifelong payout that must be started early in adulthood."

105:  "The West was eventually tamed not just by flinty-eyed marshals and hanging judges but by an influx of women."

106:  "The North is an extension of Europe and continued the court- and commerce-driven Civilizing Process that had been gathering momentum since the Middle Ages. The South and West preserved the culture of honor that sprang up in the anarchic parts of the growing country, balanced by their own civilizing forces of churches, families, and temperance."

106-7:  "For all the lags and mismatches between the historical trajectories of the United States and Europe, they did undergo one trend in synchrony: their rates of violence did a U-turn in the 1960s. [...] European countries underwent a bounce in homicide rates that brought them back to levels they had said goodbye to a century before. [...] in the 1960s the homicide rate in America went through the roof. After a three-decade free fall that spanned the Great Depression, WOrld War II, and the Cold War, Americans multiplied their homicide rate by more than two and a half, from a low of 4.0 in 1957 to a high of 10.2 in 1980. The upsurge included every other category of major crime as well, including rape, assault, robbery, and theft, and lasted (with ups and downs) for three decades. The cities got particularly dangerous, especially New York, which became a symbol of the new criminality. Though the surge in violence affected all the races and both genders, it was most dramatic among black men, whose annual homicide rate had shot up by the mid-1980s to 72 per 100,000."

107:  "The flood of violence from the 1960s through the 1980s reshaped American culture, the political scene, and everyday life."

107-8:  "The rebounding of violence in the 1960s defied every expectation. The decade was a time of unprecedented economic growth, nearly full employment, levels of economic equality for which people today are nostalgic, historic race progress, and the blossoming of government social programs, not to mention medical advances that made victims more likely to survive being shot or knifed."

108:  "If it were just a matter of there being more teenagers and twenty-somethings who were committing crimes at their usual rates, the increase in crime from 1960 to 1970 would have been 13 percent, not 135 percent. Young men weren't simply more numerous than their predecessors; they were more violent too."

109:  "In many ways the new generation tried to push back against the eight-century movement described by Norbert Elias."

109:  "This common knowledge [network TV/mass media], as economists and logicians call it, gave rise to a horizontal web of solidarity that cut across the vertical ties to parents and authorities that had formerly isolated young people from one another and forced them to kowtow to their elders."

109-10:  "A sense of solidarity among fifteen-to-thirty-year-olds would be a menace to civilized society even in the best of times. But this decivilizing process was magnified by a trend that had been gathering momentum throughout the 20th century. The sociologist Cas Wouters, a translator and intellectual heir of Elias, has argued that after the European Civilizing Process had run its course, it was superseded by an *informalizing process*. The Civilizing Process had been a flow of norms and manners from the upper classes downward. But as Western countries became more democratic, the upper classes became increasingly discredited as moral paragons, and hierarchies of taste and manners were leveled [sic]. The informalization affected the way people dressed, as they abandoned hats, gloves, ties, and dresses for casual sportswear. It affect the language, as people started to address their friends with first names instead of *Mr.* and *Mrs.* and *Miss*. And it could be seen in countless other ways in which speech and demeanor became less mannered and more spontaneous."

110:  "After having been steadily beaten down by the informalizing process, the elites then suffered a second hit to their legitimacy. The civil rights movement had exposed a moral blot on the American establishment, and as critics shone a light on other parts of society, more stains came into view. Among them were the threat of a nuclear holocaust, the pervasiveness of poverty, the mistreatment of Native Americans, the many illiberal military interventions, particularly the Vietnam War, and later the despoliation of the environment and the oppression of women and homosexuals. The state enemy of the Western establishment, Marxism, gained prestige as it made inroads in third-world 'liberation' movements, and it was increasingly embraced by bohemians and fashionable intellectuals. Surveys of popular opinion from the 1960s through the 1990s showed a plummeting of trust in every social institution."

111:  "Together with self-control and societal connectedness, a third ideal came under attack: marriage and family life, which had done much to domesticate male violence in the preceding decades."

Eliding here. The first point--now glossed as 'societal connectedness'--was originally expressed in terms in the decline of the moral authority of the elites due to, among other things, growing solidarity among youth. The issue isn't the 'ideal' of 'societal connectedness' coming into disrepute, but rather a horizontal rather than vertical version of 'connectedness.'
	
115:  "Even more calamitous than the return of hoodlums to the street was the mutual disengagement between law enforcement and communities, and the resulting deterioration of neighborhood life."

115:  "The 1960s decivilizing process affected the choices of individuals as well as policymakers. Many young men decided that they ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more and, instead of pursuing a respectable family life, hung out in all-male packs that spawned the familiar cycle of competition for dominance, insult or minor aggression, and violent retaliation."

119:  "Among economic measures, inequality is generally a better predictor of violence than unemployment."

121:  "So how *can* we explain the recent crime decline? [...] The first is that the Leviathan got bigger, smarter, and more effective. The second is that the Civilizing Process, which the counterculture had tried to reverse in the 1960s, was restored to its forward direction. Indeed, it seems to have entered a new phase."

121:  "By the early 1990s, Americans had gotten sick of the muggers, vandals, and drive-by shootings, and the country beefed up the criminal justice system in several ways. The most effective was also the crudest: putting more men behind bars for longer stretches of time."

122:  "Imprisonment physically removes the most crime-prone individuals from the streets, incapacitating them and subtracting the crimes they would have committed from the statistics. Incarceration is especially effective when a small number of individuals commit a large number of crimes."

123:  "A second way in which Leviathan became more effective in the 1990s was a ballooning of the police. [...] Additional cops not only nab more criminals but are more noticeable by their presence, deterring people from committing crimes in the first place. And many of the police earned back their old nickname *flatfoots* by walking a beat and keeping an eye on the neighborhood rather than sitting in cars and awaiting a radio call before speeding to a crime scene. [...] The visibility of the police was multiplied by a mandate to go after nuisance crimes like graffiti, littering, aggressive panhandling, drinking liquor or urinating in public, and extorting cash from drivers at stoplights after a cursory wipe of their windshield with a filthy squeegee. The rationale, originally articulated by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in their famous Broken Windows theory, was that an orderly environment serves as a reminder that police and residents are dedicated to keeping the peace, whereas a vandalized and unruly one is a signal that no one is in charge."

125:  "The Great Crime Decline of the 1990s was part of a change in sensibilities that can fairly be called a recivilizing process. To start with, some of the goofier ideas of the 1960s had lost their appeal. The collapse of communism and a recognition of its economic and humanitarian catastrophes took the romance out of revolutionary violence and cast doubt on the wisdom of redistributing wealth at the point of a gun."

Chapter 4: The Humanitarian Revolution
---

130:  "But the sporadic, clandestine, and universally decried eruptions of torture in recent times cannot be equated with the centuries of institutionalized sadism in medieval Europe. Torture in the Middle Ages was not hidden, denied, or euphemized. It was not just a tactic by which brutal regimes intimidated their political enemies or moderate regimes extracted information from suspected terrorists. It did not erupt from a frenzied crowd stirred up in hatred against a dehumanized enemy. No, torture was woven into the fabric of public life. It was a form of punishment that was cultivated and celebrated, an outlet for artistic and technological creativity."

132:  "Both the Christian and secular legal systems, inspired by Roman law, used torture to extract a confession and thereby convict a suspect, in defiance of the obvious fact that a person will say anything to stop the pain."

This is completely wrong.

133:  "In the modern West and much of the rest of the world, capital and corporal punishments have been effectively eliminated, governments' power to use violence against their subjects has been severely curtailed, slavery has been abolished, and people have lost their thirst for cruelty. All this happened in a narrow slice of history, beginning in the Age of Reason in the 17th century and cresting with the Enlightenment at the end of the 18th."

133:  "Some of this progressed--and if it wasn't progress, I don't know what is--was propelled by ideas: by explicit arguments that institutionalized violence ought to be minimized or abolished. And some of it was propelled by a change in sensibilities. People began to *sympathize* with more of their fellow humans, and were no longer indifferent to their suffering."

134:  "The most benighted form of institutionalized violence is human sacrifice: the torture and killing of an innocent person to slake a deity's thirst for blood."

135:  "Many institutionalized killings, however unforgivable, are at least understandable. People in power kill in order to eliminate enemies, deter troublemakers, or demonstrate their prowess. But sacrificing harmless children, going to war to capture victims, and raising a doomed caste from childhood hardly seem like cost-effective ways to stay in power."

136:  "Something about mature, literate states eventually leads them to think the better of human suffering. One possibility is that the combination of a literate elite, the rudiments of historical scholarship, and contacts with neighboring societies gives people the means to figure out that the bloodthirsty-god hypothesis is incorrect. They infer that throwing a virgin into a volcano does not, in fact, cure diseases, defeat enemies, or bring them good weather. Another possibility, favoured by [James] Payne, is that a more affluent and predictable life erodes people's fatalism and elevates their valuation of other people's lives. Both theories are plausible, but neither is easy to prove, because it's hard to find any scientific or economic advance that coincides with the abandonment of human sacrifice."

Note: Pinker's source for these claims, James Payne, is a fellow at the Independent Institute, a right wing libertarian think tank in California.

139:  "In most of the world, institutionalized superstitious killing, wheter in human sacrifice, blood libel, or witch persecution, has succumbed to two pressures. One is intellectual: the realization that some events, even those with profound personal significance, must be attributed to impersonal physical forces and raw chance rather than the designs of other conscious beings."

139:  "The other pressure is harder to explain but just as forceful: an increased valuation of human life and happiness."

143:  "One gets a sense that people started to place a higher value on human life. Part of this newfound appreciation was an emotional change: a habit of identifying with the pains and pleasures of others. And another part was an intellectual and moral change: a shift from valuing *souls* to valuing *lives*."

145:  "But the practical function of cruel punishments was just a part of their appeal. Spectators *enjoyed* cruelty, even when it served no judicial purpose."

153:  "It [execution] is one of the many cases in which institutionalized violence was once seen as indispensable to the functioning of a society, yet once it was abolished, the society managed to get along perfectly well without it."

159:  "He who loves by the sword dies by the sword, and in most of human history political murder--a challenger killing a leader and taking his place--was the primary mechanism for the transfer of power."

159:  "Manuel Eisner has calculated that between 600 and 1800 CE, about one in eight European monarchs was murdered in office, mostly by noblemen, and that a third of the killers took over the throne."

161:  "the value of the early designs for democracy was their upgradability."

165:  "Together with satires suggesting that war was hypocritical and contemptible, the 18th century saw the appearance of theories holding that it was irrational and avoidable. One of the foremost was gentle commerce, the theory that the positive-sum payoff of trade should be more appealing than the zero-sum or negative-sum payoff of war. Though the mathematics of game theory would not be available for another two hundred years, the key idea could be stated easily enough in words: Why spend money and blood to invade a country and plunder its treasures when you can just buy it from them at less expense and sell them some of your own?"

166:  "More important, democracies tend to avoid wars because the benefits of war go to a country's leaders whereas the costs are paid by its citizens. [...] But if the citizens are in charge, they will think twice about wasting their own money and blood on a foolish foreign adventure."

167:  "Each of two democracies can recognize the validity of the principles that govern the other. That sets them apart from theocracies, which are based on parochial faiths, and from autocracies, which are based on clans, dynasties, or charismatic leaders. In other words, if one state has reason to believe that a neighboring one organizes its political affairs in the same way that it does because both have stumbled upon the same solution to the problem of government, then neither has to worry about the other one attacking, neither will be tempted to attack the other in preemptive self-defense, and so on, freeing everyone from the Hobbesian trap."

169:  "In explaining the Humanitarian Revolution, then, we don't have to decide between unspoken norms and explicit moral argumentation. Each affects the other. As sensibilities change, thinkers who question a practice are more likely to materialize, and their arguments are more likely to get a hearing and then catch on. The arguments may not only persuade the people who wield the levers of power but infiltrate the culture's sensibilities by finding their way into barroom and dinner-table debates where they may shift the consensus one mind at a time."

169:  "As always, the challenge is to find an exogenous change that precedes the change in sensibilities and behavior so we can avoid the circularity of saying that people stopped doing cruel things because they got less cruel."

170:  "The enhanced decorum [of the civilizing process], she [Lynn Hunt] suggests, contributed to the sense that people are *autonomous*--that they own their own bodies, which have an inherent integrity and are not a possession of society. Bodily integrity was increasingly seen as worthy of respect, as something that may not be breached at the expense of the person for the benefit of society."

170:  "An alternative explanation is that people become more compassionate as their own lives improve."

174:  "People began to read secular rather than just religious material, to read to themselves instead of in groups, and to read a wide range of topical media, such as pamphlets and periodicals, rather than rereading a few canonical texts like almanacs, devotional works, and the Bible."

174:  "The growth of writing and literacy strikes me as the best candidate for an exogenous change that helped set off the Humanitarian Revolution."

Why did reading suddenly take off?

175:  Two senses of empathy: "adopting someone's viewpoint" and "feeling compassion toward the person"

176:  "Hunt suggests a causal chain: reading epistolary novels about characters unlike oneself exercises the ability to put oneself in other people's shoes, which turns one against cruel punishments and other abuses of human rights."

177:  "And it may have contributed in a second way: by creating a hothouse for new ideas about moral values and the social order."

180:  "The universe of ideas, in which one idea entails others, is itself an exogenous force, and once a community of thinkers enters that universe, they will be forced in certain directions regardless of their material surroundings."

182:  "The commonality of basic human responses across cultures has profound implications. One is that there is a universal human nature. It encompasses our common pleasures and pains, our common methods of reasoning, and our common vulnerability to folly (not least the desire for revenge). Human nature may be studied, just as anything else in the world may be. And our decisions on how to organize our lives can take the facts of human nature into account--including the discounting of our own intuitions when a scientific understanding casts them in doubt."

183:  "This line of reasoning may be called humanism because the value that it recognizes is the flourishing of humans, the only value that cannot be denied. I experience pleasures and pains, and pursue goals in service of them, so I cannot reasonably deny the right of other sentient agents to do the same."

Chapter 5: The Long Peace
---

191:  "the radical possibility that World War II was a statistical fluke--that it was neither a step in an escalating series nor a harbinger of things to come, and not part of a trend at all."

192:  long-term trends in warfare: "No cycles", "A big dose of randomness", "An escalation, recently reversed, in the destructiveness of war", and "Declines in every other dimension of war, and thus in interstate war as a whole".

193:  "while the 20th century certainly had more violent deaths than earlier ones, it also had more people."

193:  "*historical myopia*: the closer an era is to our vantage point in the present, the more details we can make out."

203:  "In a Poisson process, events occur continuously, randomly, and independently of one another. [...] For reasons we have just seen, in a Poisson process the intervals between events are distributed exponentially: there are lots of shot intervals and fewer and fewer of them as they get longer and longer. That implies that events that occur at random will seem to come in clusters, because it would take a *non*random process to space them out."

206:  "Richardson's major discovery about the timing of wars is that they begin at random."

206:  "Richardson found that not only are the onsets of wars randomly timed; so are their offsets."

212:  "Scientists are intrigued by power-law distributions for two reasons. One is that the distribution keeps turning up in measurements of things that you would think have nothing in common."

213:  "The second remarkable thing about power-law distributions is that they look the same over a vast range of values."

215:  "power-law distributions with the exponent we see for wars do not even have a finite mean. THere is no such thing as a 'typical war.'"

215:  "power-law distributions are *scale-free*. As you slide up or down the line the log-log graph, it always looks the same, namely, like a line. The mathematical implication is that as you magnify or shrink the units you are looking at, the distribution looks the same."

215:  "power-law distributions have 'thick tails,' meaning that they have a nonnegligible number of extreme values."

215:  "The thick tail of a power-law distribution, which declines gradually rather than precipitously as you rocket up the magnitude scale, means that extreme values are *extremely unlikely* but not *astronomically unlikely*."

221:  "the most damaging kinds of lethal violence (at least from 1820 to 1952) were murders and world wars; all the other kinds of quarrels killed far fewer people."

222:  "That the two world wars killed 77 percent of the people who died in all the wars that took place in a 130-year period is an extraordinary discovery. Wars don't even follw the 80:20 rule that we are accustomed to seeing in power-law distributions. They follow an 80:2 rule: almost 80 percent of the deaths were caused by 2 *percent* of the wars. The lopsided ratio tells us that the global effort to prevent deaths in war should give the highest priority to preventing largest wars."

But, didn't we determine that there was no way to predict in advance which war would be small versus large?

222:  "The two world wars were, in a sense, horrifically unlucky samples from a statistical distribution that stretches across a vast range of destruction."

223:  "at any time a small number of eight-hundred-pound gorillas are responsible for a majority of the mayhem. The great powers participated in about 70 percent of all the wars that Wright included in his half-millennium database for the entire world, and four of them have the dubious honor of having participated in at least a fifth of all European wars. [...] Countries that slip in or out of the great power league fight far more wars when they are in than when they are out."

231:  "Modern Europe began in a Hobbesian state of frequent but small wars. The wars became fewer in number as political units became consolidated into larger states. At the same time the wars that did occur were becoming more lethal, because of a military revolution that created larger and more effective armies. Finally, in different periods European countries veered between totalizing ideologies that subordinated individual people's interests to a utopian vision and an Englightenment humanism that elevated those interests as the ultimate value."

239:  "the French Revolution, became associated in Europe with the French Enlightenment. In fact it is better classified as the first implementation of fascism."

Why?

242:  "Another development of the 19th century that would undo Europe's long interval of peace was romantic militarism: the doctrine that war itself as a salubrious activity, quite apart from its strategic goals."

245:  "the 19th century was host to yet another movement: a continuation of the Enlightenment critique of war. Unlike the strain of liberalism that developed a soft spot for nationalism, this one kept its eye on the individual human being as the entity whose interests are paramount. And it invoked the Kantian principles of democracy, commerce, universal citizenship, and international law as practical means of implementing peace."

248:  "Hitler exploited the world's war-weariness..."

BUT: we've ruled out war-weariness as a real phenomenom that either explains war or non-war.

277:  "The psychology behind Global Zero is to extend the taboo on *using* nuclear weapons to a taboo on *possessing* them. Taboos depend on a mutual understanding that there are bright lines delineating all-or-none categories, and the line distinguishing zero from more-than-zero is the brightest of all."

281:  "not that democracies *never* go to war (in which case every putative counterexample becomes a matter of life or death) but that they go to war *less often* than nondemocracies, all else being equal."

287:  "A democratic peace strongly kicks in only when *both* members of a pair of countries are democratic, but the effects of commerce are demonstrable when *either* member of the pair has a market economy."

290:  "Russett and Oneal propose that membership in intergovernmental organizations is the third vertex of a triangle of pacifying forces which they attribute to Kant, the other two being democracy and trade."

290:  "The researchers concluded that Kant got it right three out of three times: democracy favors peace, trade favors peace, and membership in intergovernmental organizations favors peace."

Chapter 6: The New Peace
---

296:  "three kinds of organized violence that have stoked the new pessimism."

296:  "The first kind of organized violence embraces all other categories of war, most notably the civil wars and wars between militias, guerrillas, and paramilitaries that plague the developing world."

296:  "The second kind of organized violence I will track is the mass killing of ethnic and political groups."

297:  "The third kind is terrorism."

302:  "Even if we were to multiply the recent figures by five, they would sit well below the world's overall homicide rate of 8.8 per 100,000 per year."

305:  "One major change has been in the theater of armed conflict. Wars today take place mainly in poor countries, mostly in an arc that extends from Central and East Africa through the Middle East, across Southwest Asia and northern India, and down into Southeast Asia."

305:  "About half of the conflicts take place in the countries with the poorest sixth of the people."

307:  "There must be a third variable [in addition to land/food and natural resources], presumably the norms and skills of a civilized trading society, that causes both wealth and peace."

307:  "Their effects [structural variables], though, interact with the country's form of governance. The thickening of the civil war wedge in the 1960s had an obvious trigger: decolonization."

307:  Quoting an unidentified Bosnian Croat: "We lived in peace and harmnony because every hundred meters we had a policeman to make sure we loved each other very much."

308:  "Ideologies, whether relious or political, push wars out along the tail of the deadliness distribution because they inflame leaders into trying to outlast their adversaries in destructive wars of attrition, regardless of the human costs."

309:  "A world that is less invigorated by honor, glory, and ideology and more tempted by the pleasures of bourgeois life is a world in which fewer people are killed."

310:  "go to the mountains and grow bears, or do nothing and stay a modern country."

311:  "Countries with an abundance of nonrenewable, easily monopolized resources have slower economic growth, crappier governments, and more violence."

321:  "killing-by-category targets people for what they *are* rather than what they *do* and thus seems to flout the usual motivces of gain, fear, and vengeance."

327:  Noting the use of biological metaphors in dehumanization: "The human mind has evolved a defense against contamination by biological agents: the emotion of disgust. [...] disgust impels people to eject the polluting substance and anything that looks like it or has been in contact with it. Digust is easily moralized [...]. And so we see disgusting agents as not just physically repellent but also morally contemptible."

328:  "to kill by the millions you need an *ideology*."

Subsequent examples suggest that an ideology is whatever causes people to kill by the millions. Not an especially rigorous definition.

328:  "Utopian ideologies invite genocide for two reasons. One is that they set up a pernicious utilitarian calculus."

329:  "The second genocidal hazard of a utopia is that it has to conform to a tidy blueprint."

336:  "His [Rummel] definition of 'democide' corresponds roughly to the UCDP's 'one-sided violence' and to our everyday concept of 'murder' but with a government rather than an individual as the perpetrator: the victims must be unarmed, and the killing deliberate."

This is hardly "our everyday concept of murder."

340-1:  "Harff was tasked not just with compiling genocides but with identifying their risk factors. She noted that virtually all of them took place in the aftermath of a state failure such as a civil war, revolution, or coup."

341-2:  "six risk factors that distinguished the genocidal from the nongenocidal crises [...]. One was a country's previous history of genocide [...]. The second predictor was the country's immediate history of political instability [...]. A third was a ruling elite that came from an ethnic minority [...]. [...] democracy is a key factor in preventing genocides. [...] openess to trade. [...] The last predictor of genocide is an exclusionary ideology."

345:  "terrorism is generally understood as premeditated violence perpetrated by a nonstate actor against noncombatants (civilians or off-duty soldiers) in pursuit of a political, religious, or social goal, designed to coerce a government or to intimidate or convey a message to a larger audience."

346:  Perceived danger of a risk depends on two factors:  "fathomability: it's better to deal with the devil you know than the devil you don't. People are nervous about risks that are novel, undetectable, delayed in their effects, and poorly understood by the science of the day. The second contributor is dread. People worry about worst-case scenarios, the ones that are uncontrollable, catastrophic, involuntary, and inequitable (the people exposed to the risk are not the ones who benefit from it).

346:  "Fallacies in risk perception are known to distort public policy. Money and laws have been directed at keeping additives out of food and chemical residues out of water supplies which pose infinitesimal risks to health, while measures that demonstrably save lives, such as enforcing lower highway speeds, are resisted.

353:  "The only real technological hurdle is the willingness of the young man. Ordinarily a human being is unwilling to die, the legacy of half a billion years of natural selection. How have terrorist leaders overcome this obstacle?"

356:  "Far from being ignorant, impoverished, nihilistic, or mentally ill, suicide terrorists tend to be educated, middle class, morally engaged, and free of obvious psychopathology."

368:  "Terrorist attacks obey a power-law distribution, which means they are generated by mechanisms that make extreme events unlikely, but not astronomically unlikely."

Chapter 7: The Rights Revolution
---

379:  "But in the past half-century the momentum has been going squarely against boys of all ages."

380:  "The efforts to stigmatize, and in many cases criminalize, temptations to violence have been advanced in a cascade of campaigns for 'rights'--civil rights, women's rights, children's rights, gay rights, and animal rights."

What's with the scare-quotes around "rights"?

381:  "The code of etiquette bequeathed by this and the other Rights Revolutions is pervasive enough to have acquired a name. We call it political correctness."

Who is this we?

382:  "The oppression of women used to include laws that allowed husbands to rape, beat, and confine their wives; today it is applied to elite universities whose engineering departments do not have a fifty-fifty ratio of male and female professors."

Where is this the case given that such "quotas" are illegal?

383:  "An ethnic riot combines aspects of genocide and terrorism with features of its own. Unlike these two other forms of collective violence, it is not planned, has no articulated ideology, and is not masterminded by a leader or implemented by a government or militia, though it does depend on the government sympathizing with the perpetrators and looking the other way. Its psychological roots, though, are the same as those of genocide."

385:  "The murder took place a few years after the FBI had begun to gather statistics on so-called hate crimes, namely acts of violence that target a person because of race, religion, or sexual orientation."

So-called?

386:  "The so-called race riots of the mid-1960s in Los Angeles, Newark, Detroit, and other American cities represented a different phenomenon altogether: African Americans were the rioters rather than the targets, death tolls were low (mostly rioters themselves killed by the police), and virtually all the targets were property rather than people."

388:  "Horowitz identifies several reasons for the disappearance of deadly ethnic riots in the West. One is governance. For their abandon in assaulting their victims, rioters are sensitive to their own safety, and know when the police will turn a blind eye. Prompt law enforcement can quell riots and nip cycles of group-against-group revenge in the bud, but the procedures have to be thought out in advance. Since the local police often come from the same ethnic gorup as the perpetrators and may sympathize with their hatreds, a professionalized national militia is more effectivve than the neighborhood cops. And since riot police can cause more deaths than they prevent, they must be trained to apply the minimal force needed to disperse a mob."

388:  "The other cuase of the disappearance of deadly ethnic riots is more nebulous: a rising ahborrence of violence, and of even the slightest trace of a mindset that might lead to it."

427:  "Modern sensibilities have increasingly conceived moral worth in terms of *consciousness*, particularly the ability to suffer and flourish, and have identified consciousness with the activity of the brain."

446:  "The annual number of abuctions by strangers has ranged from 200 to 300 in the 1990s to about 100 today, around half of whom are murdered. With 50 million children in the United States, that works out to an annual homicide rate of one in a million (0.001 per hundred thousand, to use our usual metric). That's about a twentieth of the risk of drowning and a fortieth of the risk of a fatal car accident. The writer Warwick Cairns calculated that if you *wanted* your child to be kidnapped and held overnight by a stranger, you'd have to leave the child outside and unattended for 750,000 years."

477:  "If I were to put my money on the single most important exogenous cause of the Rights Revolution, it would be the technologies that made ideas and people increasingly mobile."

478:  "the key to material success is being situated in a large catchment area of innovations."

482:  "Violence is found throughout the history and prehistory of our species, and shows no signs of having been invented in one place and spreaad to the others."

482:  "Let to their own devices, humans will not fall into a state of peaceful cooperation, but nor do they have a thirst for blood that must regularly be slaked."

483:  "So let me begin by convincing you that most of us--including you, dear reader--are wired for violence, even if in all likelihood we will never have an occasion to use it."

486:  "If violence is stamped into our childhoods, our fantasy lives, our art, and our brains, then how is it possible that soldiers are reluctant to fire their guns in combat, when taht is what they are to do?"

488:  "[Roy] Baumeister was moved to study [in *Evil*] the commonsense understanding of evil when he noticed that the people who perpetrate destructive acts, from everyday peccadilloes to serial murders and genocides, never think they are doing anything wrong."

490-1:  "A social group is a marketplace of cooperators of differing degrees of generosity and trustworthiness, and people advertise themselves as being generous and trustworthy as they can get away with, which may be a bit more generous and trustworthy than they are."

497:  "The most obvious form of aggression in the animal kingdom is predation. [...] Yet biologically speaking, predation for food could not be more different from aggression against rivals and threats."

502:  "THe neuroanatomy suggests that in *Homo sapiens* primitive impulses of rage, fear, and craving must contend with the cerebral restraints of prudence, moralization, and self-control--though as in all attempts at taming the wild, it's not always clear who has the upper hand."

508-9:  Five causes/roots/categories (Pinker is confused on what he is talking about using he terms interchangeably): practical ("use of force as a means to an end"), dominance ("drive for supremac over one's rivals"), revenge ("the drive to pay back a harm in kind), sadism ("the joy of hurting," "puzzling and horrifying in equal measure"), and ideology ("most consequential," "true believers weave a collection of motives into a creed and recruit other people to carry out its destructive ends," "cannot be identified with a part of the brain or evevn with a whole brain, because it is distributed across the brains of many people").

509:  "Because predatory violence is just a means to a goal, it comes in as many varieties as there are human goals. The paradigm case is literal predation--hunting for food or sport--because it involves no animosity toward the victim."

*or*? *no*? And then goes on to discuss that hunter's actually identify with their prey and valorize their prey. But, why is this explanation taken at face value given, for instance, the long discussion of perpetrator vs. victim narratives? 

509:  Indeed, he comments, "There may even be an element of love."

519:  "Incidentally, the first law of violence--it's something that young men do--is easier to document than to explain. Though it's clear why men should have evolved to be more violent than women, it's not so clear why young men should be more violent than old men."

528:  "We don't know what causes what, but biology and history suggest that all else being equal, a world in which women have more influence will be a world with fewer wars."

547:  "It's hard to single out the most heinous form of human depravity--there are so many to choose from--but if genocide is the worst by quantity, sadism might be the worst by quality."

549:  "The development of sadism requires two things: motives to enjoy the suffering of others, and a removal of the restraints that ordinarily inhibit people from acting on them."

557:  "The overall problem is that groups take on an identity of their own in people's minds, and individuals' desire to be accepted within a group, and to promote its standing in comparison to other groups, can override their better judgment."

Seems to suggest that groups are properties of individuals rather than being real in their own right.

569:  "Yet much of the decline in violence seems to have come from changes in the times."

Suggests that the change is sociological rather than psychological.

574:  "The original and most mechanical sense of empathy is *projection*--the ability to put oneself into the position of some other person, animal, or object, and imagine the sensation of being in that situation."

574:  "Closely related is the skill of *perspective-taking*, namely visualizing what the world looks like from another's vantage point."

575:  "*Mind-reading*, *theory of mind*, *mentalizing*, or *emphatic accuracy* is the ability to figure out what someone is thinking or feeling from their expressions, behavior, or circumstances. [...] Mind-reading may in fact comprise two abilities, one for reading thoughts (which is impaired by autism), the other for reading emotions (which is impaired in psychopathy)."

576:  Different from sympathy, which "consists in aligning another entity's well-being with one's own, based on a cognizance of their pleasures and pains."

590:  "empathy can *subvert* human well-being when it runs afoul of a more fundamental principle, fairness."

591:  "The other problem with empathy is that it is too parochial to serve as a force for a universal consideration of people's interests."

591:  "What really has expanded is not so much a circle of empathy as a circle of *rights*--a commitment that other living things, no matter how distant or dissimilar, be safe from harm and exploitation."

621:  "So while recent biological evolution may, in theory, have tweaked our inclinations toward violence and nonviolence, we have no good evidence that it actually has. At the same time, we do have good evidence for changes that could not possibly be genetic, because they unfolded on time scales that are too rapid to be explained by natural selection, even with the new understanding of how recently it has acted."

622:  "When it comes to virulent ideologies, morality may be the disease, but morality is also the cure."

671:  "Declines of violence are a product of social, cultural, and material conditions. If the conditions persist, violence will remain low or decline even further; if they don't, it won't."

673:  Technological determinism of weapons does not cause an increase or decrease in violence.

674:  Distribution of finite natural resources does not cause an increase or decrease in violence.

675:  Distribution of wealth does not cause an increase or decrease in violence.

678:  Religion does not cause an increase or decrease in violence.

680:  "A state that uses a monopoly on force to protect its citizens from one another may be the most consistent violence-reducer that we have encountered in this book."

683:  "once people are enticed into voluntary exchange, they are encouraged to take each other's perspectives to clinch the best deal ('the customer is always right'), which in turn may lead them to respectful consideration of each other's interests, if not necessarily to warmth."

683:  Attributes to Elias the view that the civilizing process = leviathan + gentle commerce.

684:  "many cultures maintain active networks of exchange, even when the goods exchanged are useless gifts, because they know it helps keep the peace among them."

685:  "a more feminized world is a more peaceful world."

686:  "Feminization need not consist of women literally wielding more power in decisions on whether to go to war. It can also consist in a society moving away from a culture of manly honor, with its approval of violent retaliation for insults, toughening of boys through physical punishment, and veneration of martial glory."

687:  "violence is always a bad thing except when it prevents greater violence"

688:  "Violence is a problem not just of too many males but of too many *young* males."

688:  "Several varieties of feminization, then--direct political empowerment, the deflation of manly honor, the promotion of marriage on women's terms, the right of girls to be born, and women's control over their own reproduction--have been forces in the decline of violence."

689:  "smaller increments in the valuation of other people's interests--say, a susceptibility to pangs of guilt when thinking about enslaving, torturing, or annihilating others--could shift the likelihood of aggressing against them."

690:  "The first [expanding circle] involves occupying another person's vantage point and imagining his or her emotions as if they were one's own. The second [escalator of reason] involves ascending to an Olympian, superrational vantage point--the perspective of eternity, the view from nowhere--and considering one's own interests and another person's as equivalent."

691:  "A humanistic value system, which privileges human flourishing as the ultimate good, is a product of reason because it can be *justified*: it can be mutually agreed upon by any community of thinkings who value their own interests and are engaged in reasoned negotiation, whereas communal and authoritarian values are parochial to a tribe or hierarchy."

691:  "the evidence suggests that value systems evolve in the direction of liberal humanism."

692:  "The decline in violence may be the most signficant and least appreciated development in the history of our species."

692:  "A loathing of modernity is one of the great constants of contemporary social criticism."
