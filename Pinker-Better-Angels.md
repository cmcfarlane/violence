Preface
--

xxi:  "This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened in human history. Believe it or not--and I know that most people do not--violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence. The decline, to be sure, has not been smooth; it has not brought violence down to zero; and it is not guaranteed to continue. But it is an unmistakable development, visible on scales from millennia to years, from the waging of wars to the spanking of children."

xxi:  "How, in particular, are we to make sense of *modernity*--of the erosion of family, tribe, tradition, and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason, and science? So much depends on how we understand the legacy of this transition: whether we see our world as a nightmare of crime, terrorism, genocide, and war, or as a period that, by the standards of history, is blessed by unprecedented levels of peaceful coexistence."

xxii:  "By the standards of the mass atrocities of human history, the lethal injection of a murderer in Texas, or an occasional hate crime in which a member of an ethnic minority is intimidated by hooligans, is pretty mild stuff. But from a contemporary vantage point, we see them as signs of how low our behaviour can sink, not of how high our standards have risen."

	Okay, but is this the correct standard? Playing off a murder versus the Holocaust?

xxii:  "The problems I have set out to understand is the reduction in violence at many scales--in the family, in the neighbourhood, between tribes and other armed factions, and among major nations and states."

xxiii:  "My approach is scientific in the broad sense of seeking explanations for why things happen."

xxiii:  "Social scientists distinguish 'endogenous' variables--those that are inside the system, where they may be affected by the very phenomenon they are trying to explain--from the 'exogenous' ones--those that are set in motion by forces from the outside. Exogenous forces can originate in the practical realm, such as changes in technology, demographics, and the mechanisms of commerce and governance. But they can also originate in the intellectual realm, as new ideas are conceived and disseminated and take on a life of their own."

xxiv-xxv:  The (so-called) exogenous causes:

1. Pacification Process: agriculture, especially movement from hunter/gatherer to sedentary forms of organization;
2. Civilizing Process: state-formation, especially centralized states as opposed to feudal;
3. Humanitarian Revolution: organized efforts to abolish "social sanctioned forms of violence like despotism, slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, sadistic punishment, and cruelty to animals";
4. Long Peace: since end of WWII (1945) the "great states" have not been inclined to go to war with one another, including USSR/USA;
5. New Peace: since end of Cold War (1989), there have been fewer genocides, wars, civil wars, etc;
6. Rights Revolutions: since UDHR (1948), recognition of rights of minorities and prohibitions on violence against them.

xxv:  "Five Inner Demons"--neurological bases of violence:

1. Predatory/instrumental violence: "simply violence deployed as a practical means to an end";
2. Dominance: "the urge for authority, prestige, glory, and power";
3. Revenge: "moralistic urge toward retribution, punishment, and justice";
4. Sadism: "pleasure taken in another's suffering";
5. Ideology: "shared belief system, usually involving a vision of utopia, that justifies unlimited violence in pursuit of unlimited good."

xxv: "Four Better Angels"--neurological bases of peacefulness, cooperation, trust:

1. Empathy: "prompts us to feel the pain of others and to align their interests with our own";
2. Self-control: "anticipate the consequences of acting on our impulses and to inhibit them accordingly";
3. Moral sense: "sanctifies a set of norms and taboos that govern the interactions among people in a culture, sometimes in ways that decrease violence, though often (when the norms are tribal, authoritarian, or puritanical) in ways that increase it";
4. Reason: "allows us to extricate ourselves from our parochial vantage points, to reflect on the ways in which we live our lives, to deduce ways in which we could be better off, and to guide the application of the other better angels of our nature".

xxv-xxvi: "Five Historical Forces"--"exogenous forces that favour our peaceable motives and that have driven the multiple declines in violence":

1. Leviathan: "a state and judiciary with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, can defuse the temptation of exploitative attack, inhibit the impulse for revenge, and circumvent the self-serving biases that make all parties believe they are on the side of the angels";
2. Commerce: "a positive-sum game in which everybody can win";
3. Feminization: "process in which cultures have increasingly respected the interests and values of women";
4. Cosmopolitanism: "literacy, mobility, and mass media can prompt people to take the perspective of people unlike themselves and to expand their circle of sympathy to embrace them";
5. Escalator of reason: "intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to human affairs".
