Chapter 1: The Micro-sociology of Violent Confrontations
---

1:  "It [violence] is horrible and heroic, disgusting and exciting, the most condemned and glorified of human acts."

1:  "Two moves will set up the analysis. First, put the interaction in the center of the analysis, not the individual, the social background, the culture, or even the motivation: that is to say, look for the characteristics of violent situations. That means looking for data that gets us as close as possible into the dynamics of situations. Second, compare across different kinds of violence."

1:  "Not violent individuals, but violent situations--this is what a micro-sociological theory is about. We seek the contours of situations, which shape the emotions and acts of the individuals who step inside them. It is a false lead to look for types of violent individuals, constant across situations. A huge amount of research has not yielded very strong results here."

2:  "the background conditions--poverty, race, childhood experiences--are a long way from what is crucial to the dynamics of violent situations."

3:  "even people that we think of as very violent--because they have been violent in more than one situation, or spectacularly violent on some occasion--are violent only in very particular situations."

4:  "Violence as it actually becomes visible in real-life situations is about the intertwining of human emotions of fear, anger, and excitement, in ways that run right against the conventional morality of normal situations. It is just this shocking and unexpected quality of violence, as it actually appears in the cold eye of the camera, that gives a clue to the emotional dynamics at the center of a micro-sociological theory of violence."

7:  "violent situations are relatively rare"

8:  "Once we look, we find that violence is an array of processes that all follow from a common situational feature of violence confrontations."

8:  "violence is a set of pathways around confrontational tension and fear. Despite their bluster, and even in situations of apparently uncontrolled anger, people are tense and often fearful in the immediate threat of violence--including their own violence; this is the emotional dynamic that determines what they will do if fighting actually breaks out."

8:  "all types of violence fit a small number of patterns for circumventing the barrier of tension and fear that rises up whenever people come into antagonistic confrontation."

9:  "one of the main pathways around confrontational tension and fear: find a weak victim to attack."

9:  forward panic: "much of the time confrontation is largely bluster and gesture but leads to little real harm; what is fateful are sudden breaks in the solidarity of one side, which spreads them out into an open field of small groups, where a superior number from one side can isolate and beat up an individual or two separate from their comrades."

9:  attacking the weak: "when the confrontational tension builds high, followed by a sudden collapse so that an opponent who initially seems threatening or frustrating turns out to be helpless, unleashing in the other a transformation of fear and tension into ferocious attack."

9:  fair fights: "fighters attend much more to their audience than to each other [...] the stance of the audience has an overwhelming effect on whether and how much violence is carried out. Such fights are typically stylized and limited, although what happens within those limits may be bloody enough or indeed deadly."

10:  "The most common pathway around confrontational tension and fear is a very short one, leading no further: people do not get beyond the emotional tensions of the confrontation, but confine themselves to bluster, or to finding face-saving or sometimes humiliating ways of backing down. When violence does break out, it is usually incompetent, because tension and fear remain during the performance."

10:  "One reason that real violence looks so ugly is because we have been exposed to so much mythical violence."

10:  "The fighting of all against all, I am quite certain, has never occurred as a serious matter in real life."

10-1:  "The typical response of bystanders when a fight breaks out in a crowded place is to back away to a safe distance and watch."

11:  "The Hobbesian image of humans, judging from the most common evidence, is empirically wrong."

14:  "The upshot is that we can be pretty sure, when we see a fight in the all-vs.-all mode, that this is only play-violence, not serious; the emotional tone is not confrontational tension-fear, and everyone can sense when it is or isn't."

14:  "In reality, most serious fights on the individual or small-group level are extremely short."

19:  "My aim is a general theory of violence as situational process. Violent situations are shaped by an emotional field of tension and fear. Any successful violence must overcome this tension and fear. One way this is done is by turning the emotional tension into emotional energy, usually be one side of the confrontation at the expense of the other. Successful violence battens on confrontational tension/fear as one side appropriates the emotional rhythm as dominator and the other gets caught in it as victim. But only small numbers of persons can do this. This is a structural property of situational fields, not a property of individuals.

19:  "emotional energy [EE] is a variable outcome of all interactional situations"

19:  "EE varies with the degree that the people present become entrained in each other's emotions and bodily rhythms, and caught up in a common focus of attention. These are positive experiences when all participants feel solidarity and intersubjectivity. In these successful interaction rituals, individuals come away with feelings of strength, confidence, and enthusiasm for whatever the group was doing: these feelings are what I call emotional energy."

19-20:  "Conversely, if the interaction fails to produce entrainment for certain individuals (or if they are subordinated or excluded by others), they lose EE, and come away feeling depressed, lacking in initiative, and alienated from the group's concerns."

20:  "Violent interactions are difficult because they go against the grain of normal interaction rituals. The tendency to become entrained in each other's rhythms and emotions means that when the interaction is at cross purposes--an antagonistic interaction--people experience a pervasive feeling of tension. This is what I call confrontational tension; at higher levels of intensity, it shades over into fear. For this reason, violence is difficult to carry out, not easy. Those individuals who are good at violence are those who have found a way to circumvent confrontational tension/fear, by turning the emotional situation to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of their opponent."

23:  "There is micro-sociological evidence that racism and homophobia are situationally constructed too." 

24:  Comments on Bourdieu's symbolic violence as vacuous because Bourdieu is willing to extend violence beyond the physical to include systems of domination and stratification. For Collins, violence must and only can be physical; that is to, experienced subjectively. It cannot operate objectively as a structuring condition of the situation. Thus, while the "interaction ritual" and "situational" element may give the impression of getting away from a methodologically individualist account of violence (especially insofar as he rejects explanations in terms of particular individuals), the end result remains in the range of individualism. 

25:  "'Symbolic violence' is mere theoretical word play; to take it literally would be to grossly misunderstand the nature of real violence. Symbolic violence is easy; real violence is hard. The former goes with the flow of situational interaction, making use of the normal propensities for interaction rituals. The latter goes against the interactional grain; it is because the threat of real violence runs counter to the basic mechanisms of emotional entrainment and interactional solidarity that violent situations are so difficult. It is precisely this tension that produces confrontational tension and fear, the chief feature of micro-sociological interaction on which pivot all the features of violence when it does occur."

25:  "One cannot rule out a priori the possibility that there are genetic components of human behavior. But a wide range of empirical comparisons lead to the conclusion that the genetic component, if it exists, is small, and is overwhelmed by social conditions."

27:  "This is not to say that humans cannot be in conflict. They often have conflicting interests, and they often express their antagonism toward opponents. But this antagonism is expressed for the most part against other persons (or better yet, vaguely indicated groups) who are at a distance, preferably out of sight and hearing."

29:  "if there is a historical pattern, it is that the capacity for violence has increased with the level of social organization. Violence is not primordial, and civilization does not tame it; the opposite is much nearer the truth."

Chapter 2: Confrontational Tension and Incompetent Violence
---

40:  "Fighters are mostly fearful and incompetent in their exercise of violence; when they are evenly matched, they tend to be particularly incompetent. It is when the strong attack the weak that most violence is successful."

43:  "Whatever happens in a fight situation is shaped by tension/fear: how the violence is carried out, which is to say, for the most part, incompetently; the length of fighting; and the tendency to avoid fighting once it becomes an imminent threat, and to find ways of ending it or avoid participating in it. How tension/fear is managed also determines when to what extent violence is successfully unleashed, and against whom."

44:  S.L.A. Marshall, chief combat historian for US Army during Pacific (1943) and Europe (1944-5) through post-operations interviews with soldiers determined that only about 15% of combat troops actually fired their guns and only about 25% in the most aggressive units. This, of course, does not account for actual hits. 

46:  "In Marshall's picture, a small portion of troops, on both sides, are doing all the fighting. (I will refer to this as the SLAM effect, after S.L.A. Marshall's nickname, taken from his initials.) Even they are not necessarily effective; most of their weapons miss."

	Power law distribution? 80:20?

46:  "Not uncommon is loss of control of one's sphincters, urinating or shitting in one's pants. American figures in World War II were 5 to 6 percent, up to a high of 20 percent in some combat divisions."

50:  Militaries have become better at managing fear and, consequently, at improving fire-rates. For US, 55% in Korea, 8-95% in Vietnam. 

50-1:  "The effects of tension and fear on combat performance vary historically depending on what armies do to control fear. Marshall's estimate of a minority of fighters, somewhere around a quarter of troops who actively fired their guns in combat, holds up well for the world wars of the twentieth century and for similar wars of the nineteenth century. But the estimated firing ratio for American troops in the Korean war rose to 55 percent (documented by Marshall himself); and in the Vietnam war, 80 to 95 percent, at least for the best troops. Armies have changed over the years in their organization during combat, as well as in training and recruitment. Historically earlier parade-ground formations of massed infantry firing together in ranks tended to have high firing rates, but their problem was the opposite: wild over-firing with poor aim and much in the way of friendly fire casualties. The open skirmish formations of twentieth-century wars, designed to reduce the target for machine-gun fire, eliminated the tight organizational control and put soldiers maximally on their own on the battlefield; this left them most susceptible to confrontational tension/fear, without the countervailing effects of strong social support. Recognizing this problem in response to Marshall's findings, the U.S. Army, after the Korean war, redesigned training and combat organization to promote firing and keep up social cohesion in the combat unit. Here is a rare instance where a social science finding has been used as a basis of social change. Traditional firing-range practice was replaced by realistic combat situations in which soldiers are conditioned to fire automatically at suddenly appearing targets. Recruitment too had its effects: the draftee armies of the world wars performed with a lower level of firing than volunteer enlisted armies. Thus the soldiers whom SLAM observed in World War II were those who, on all counts, would likely have had the poorest overall combat performance."

52-3:  "Given the existence of deliberate efforts in training and combat organization in the post-SLAM army to keep up firing rates, it is noteworthy that there still is a division between a highly aggressive elite and the mass of the ordinary soldiers. In this respect they are like workers in factories and other manual labor: most will do enough to give an appearance of keeping up with the average rate of work."

55-6:  Increased and sustained rates of fire seem to depend upon four factors:

1. Group/team operated weapons, such as artillery, machine guns, helicopters, etc.
2. Increased distance from the enemy: artillery, snipers have a high rate of fire; close-quarter infantry have a low rate; use of weapons in hand-to-hand combat is very low.
3. Strong command hierarchy: especially with officers present at the point of conflict giving direct orders to fire.
4. Psychologically realistic training: simulation of actual combat conditions forcing soldiers to react automatically with fire to randomly appearing targets.

	However: there is a likely distinction of disposition and training between an average infantryman and a sniper. There seems to be no accounting for professionalized and specialized forces; e.g., special forces, which presumably have a near perfect rate of fire.
	
58:  "In short, as weapons became better, overall efficiency remained low; better weapons allowed a greater volume of wild an inaccurate shooting."

59:  "Fighting is intrinsically inefficient, all the way around."

61:  "The apparently high proportion of gang-vendetta shootings that hit bystanders, and the low proportion that hit fighting members of the opposing gang, seems perversely unjust. However, it fits a well-established pattern in another area: in disaster, those most likely to die are children and old people, while able-bodied young males are most likely to survive. A fight situation resembles a disaster scene in that the most nimble and alert are most likely to evade the dangers, while the most helpless are most likely to succumb--in this case, to remain oblivious or immobile in the line of fire."

63:  "unless fights are specially organized so that they are restricted--with an explicit, high-priority concern to avoid friendly fire--the pervasive incompetence produced by the tension of conflict leads to some substantial chance of bystander injury."

64:  "As combat casualties go down, friendly-fire casualties go up."

65:  "What is sometimes called the fog of combat can also be described as a psychological condition of tunnel vision. Fighting takes up the complete attention of those who are engaged in it; it overwhelms the senses and focuses the mind so that all else fades into invisibility. It is hard enough to maintain an effective focus on the enemy; temporary obliviousness to whoever else be in the fighting zone is inevitable. This is true of angry men engaged in a cursing and gesturing match, oblivious to the consternation of bystanders; police officers who expect their blaring sirens, loud squawk boxes, fast driving, and other gestures of designating a crime scene to take precedence over all other normal human concerns; and soldiers in battle putting everything on the battlefield at their disposal, whether to occupy houses or to blow them up."

66-7:  "Soldiers in rear areas express more hatred of the enemy, and more ferocious attitudes towards them, than frontline troops. Whereas combat soldiers are more likely to treat prisoners well--once the danger point has been passed when they are actually being captured, often sharing food and water with them--rear-area troops tend to treat prisoners more callously, or even brutally. Continuing the progression, civilians at home are more likely to express violent rhetorical hatred against the enemy and blood-thirsty joy in killing them."

67:  "snipers and ace pilots are the most unusual of all fighters, competent where most are not, because of their special emotional techniques for overcoming confrontational tension." See chapter 11.

68:  "There are a variety of ways that soldiers behave in combat. This is best seen as a continuum of degrees and kinds of tension and fear, with different degrees of incompetence or competence in resulting performance. At one end is frozen incapacity, burrowing into the ground or childishly hiding from sight of the enemy. Next is panic retreat. Next comes shitting and pissing in one's pants, physical manifestations of fear but not necessarily stopping one from at least going through the motions of fighting. This part of the continuum also includes lagging back from the front line, seeking excuses to do something other than move forward, drifting away. Then comes moving forward but not firing; not firing but helping those who are firing, such as by giving them ammunition or reloading for them; then firing one's weapons but incompetently, missing the enemy. Finally, at the high end, there is accurate and well-timed firing, and other aggressive maneuvers in combat. We have as yet no clear evidence as to what the emotions are at the high end of competent violence."

70:  "Competent use of weapons is for the most part not angry. Anger is effective only in situations where sheer muscular force is at issue, and then more in the effort to exert compliance than to cause actual harm to an opponent. Anger comes out where there is little or no confrontational fear: in controlled situations where the opponent is already subdued, or in completely symbolic confrontations where there is no fighting but opinions are expressed or vented. Ironically, there is probably more anger in civilian life than in actual combat."

74:  "it is easier to put up with injury and death than it is to inflict it."

78:  Discussing bayonets, "There appears to be a special difficulty in confronting another person face to face and sticking him with a knife-edged blade. When knife attacks are used, as in commando warfare, by far the preferred method of killing is from behind, as if to avoid seeing the eyes of the man being killed."

79:  "Disfunctioning bowels are found in situations of high tension and fear, occurring in confrontations ranging from soldiers who shit their pants in combat, to burglars who give away their presence to the police by the smell they leave. Thus the expressions 'intestinal fortitude' and having the 'guts' or the 'stomach' for fighting are not merely metaphorical, but also point to a deep bodily revulsion from violence that must be overcome by those who are successful at it."

82:  "The basic tension can be called non-solidarity entrainment. It comes from trying to act against another person, and thus against one's own propensities to fall into solidarity with that person, to get into a common rhythm and common cognitive universe. It is all the harder because the violent situation has its own entrainment and focus: there is focus on the fighting itself, on the situation as a violent one, and sometimes an emotional entrainment in which the hostility, anger, and excitement of each side gets the other more angry and excited."
