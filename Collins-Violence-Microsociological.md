Chapter 1: The Micro-sociology of Violent Confrontations
---

1:  "It [violence] is horrible and heroic, disgusting and exciting, the most condemned and glorified of human acts."

1:  "Two moves will set up the analysis. First, put the interaction in the center of the analysis, not the individual, the social background, the culture, or even the motivation: that is to say, look for the characteristics of violent situations. That means looking for data that gets us as close as possible into the dynamics of situations. Second, compare across different kinds of violence."

1:  "Not violent individuals, but violent situations--this is what a micro-sociological theory is about. We seek the contours of situations, which shape the emotions and acts of the individuals who step inside them. It is a false lead to look for types of violent individuals, constant across situations. A huge amount of research has not yielded very strong results here."

2:  "the background conditions--poverty, race, childhood experiences--are a long way from what is crucial to the dynamics of violent situations."

3:  "even people that we think of as very violent--because they have been violent in more than one situation, or spectacularly violent on some occasion--are violent only in very particular situations."

4:  "Violence as it actually becomes visible in real-life situations is about the intertwining of human emotions of fear, anger, and excitement, in ways that run right against the conventional morality of normal situations. It is just this shocking and unexpected quality of violence, as it actually appears in the cold eye of the camera, that gives a clue to the emotional dynamics at the center of a micro-sociological theory of violence."

7:  "violent situations are relatively rare"

8:  "Once we look, we find that violence is an array of processes that all follow from a common situational feature of violence confrontations."

8:  "violence is a set of pathways around confrontational tension and fear. Despite their bluster, and even in situations of apparently uncontrolled anger, people are tense and often fearful in the immediate threat of violence--including their own violence; this is the emotional dynamic that determines what they will do if fighting actually breaks out."

8:  "all types of violence fit a small number of patterns for circumventing the barrier of tension and fear that rises up whenever people come into antagonistic confrontation."

9:  "one of the main pathways around confrontational tension and fear: find a weak victim to attack."

9:  forward panic: "much of the time confrontation is largely bluster and gesture but leads to little real harm; what is fateful are sudden breaks in the solidarity of one side, which spreads them out into an open field of small groups, where a superior number from one side can isolate and beat up an individual or two separate from their comrades."

9:  attacking the weak: "when the confrontational tension builds high, followed by a sudden collapse so that an opponent who initially seems threatening or frustrating turns out to be helpless, unleashing in the other a transformation of fear and tension into ferocious attack."

9:  fair fights: "fighters attend much more to their audience than to each other [...] the stance of the audience has an overwhelming effect on whether and how much violence is carried out. Such fights are typically stylized and limited, although what happens within those limits may be bloody enough or indeed deadly."

10:  "The most common pathway around confrontational tension and fear is a very short one, leading no further: people do not get beyond the emotional tensions of the confrontation, but confine themselves to bluster, or to finding face-saving or sometimes humiliating ways of backing down. When violence does break out, it is usually incompetent, because tension and fear remain during the performance."

10:  "One reason that real violence looks so ugly is because we have been exposed to so much mythical violence."

10:  "The fighting of all against all, I am quite certain, has never occurred as a serious matter in real life."

10-1:  "The typical response of bystanders when a fight breaks out in a crowded place is to back away to a safe distance and watch."

11:  "The Hobbesian image of humans, judging from the most common evidence, is empirically wrong."

14:  "The upshot is that we can be pretty sure, when we see a fight in the all-vs.-all mode, that this is only play-violence, not serious; the emotional tone is not confrontational tension-fear, and everyone can sense when it is or isn't."

14:  "In reality, most serious fights on the individual or small-group level are extremely short."

19:  "My aim is a general theory of violence as situational process. Violent situations are shaped by an emotional field of tension and fear. Any successful violence must overcome this tension and fear. One way this is done is by turning the emotional tension into emotional energy, usually be one side of the confrontation at the expense of the other. Successful violence battens on confrontational tension/fear as one side appropriates the emotional rhythm as dominator and the other gets caught in it as victim. But only small numbers of persons can do this. This is a structural property of situational fields, not a property of individuals.

19:  "emotional energy [EE] is a variable outcome of all interactional situations"

19:  "EE varies with the degree that the people present become entrained in each other's emotions and bodily rhythms, and caught up in a common focus of attention. These are positive experiences when all participants feel solidarity and intersubjectivity. In these successful interaction rituals, individuals come away with feelings of strength, confidence, and enthusiasm for whatever the group was doing: these feelings are what I call emotional energy."

19-20:  "Conversely, if the interaction fails to produce entrainment for certain individuals (or if they are subordinated or excluded by others), they lose EE, and come away feeling depressed, lacking in initiative, and alienated from the group's concerns."

20:  "Violent interactions are difficult because they go against the grain of normal interaction rituals. The tendency to become entrained in each other's rhythms and emotions means that when the interaction is at cross purposes--an antagonistic interaction--people experience a pervasive feeling of tension. This is what I call confrontational tension; at higher levels of intensity, it shades over into fear. For this reason, violence is difficult to carry out, not easy. Those individuals who are good at violence are those who have found a way to circumvent confrontational tension/fear, by turning the emotional situation to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of their opponent."

23:  "There is micro-sociological evidence that racism and homophobia are situationally constructed too." 

24:  Comments on Bourdieu's symbolic violence as vacuous because Bourdieu is willing to extend violence beyond the physical to include systems of domination and stratification. For Collins, violence must and only can be physical; that is to, experienced subjectively. It cannot operate objectively as a structuring condition of the situation. Thus, while the "interaction ritual" and "situational" element may give the impression of getting away from a methodologically individualist account of violence (especially insofar as he rejects explanations in terms of particular individuals), the end result remains in the range of individualism. 

25:  "'Symbolic violence' is mere theoretical word play; to take it literally would be to grossly misunderstand the nature of real violence. Symbolic violence is easy; real violence is hard. The former goes with the flow of situational interaction, making use of the normal propensities for interaction rituals. The latter goes against the interactional grain; it is because the threat of real violence runs counter to the basic mechanisms of emotional entrainment and interactional solidarity that violent situations are so difficult. It is precisely this tension that produces confrontational tension and fear, the chief feature of micro-sociological interaction on which pivot all the features of violence when it does occur."

25:  "One cannot rule out a priori the possibility that there are genetic components of human behavior. But a wide range of empirical comparisons lead to the conclusion that the genetic component, if it exists, is small, and is overwhelmed by social conditions."

27:  "This is not to say that humans cannot be in conflict. They often have conflicting interests, and they often express their antagonism toward opponents. But this antagonism is expressed for the most part against other persons (or better yet, vaguely indicated groups) who are at a distance, preferably out of sight and hearing."

29:  "if there is a historical pattern, it is that the capacity for violence has increased with the level of social organization. Violence is not primordial, and civilization does not tame it; the opposite is much nearer the truth."
