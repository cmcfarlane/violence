xxi-n3:  "Especially dangerous is the little word *is*, which confounds translation, allegory, classification, and ontological or psychological realization."

xxiii:  "Within historical reality, religion is a stabilizing factor of the first order in society. As such it appears in its enduring aspect, always a given tradition which is modified time and again but never replaced by something entirely new. As it unfolds within the many-faceted play of social forces, various traditions unite, thereby asserting and perpetuating themselves or languishing and dying out. In this respect, religion, while tied to social reality, does not simply reflect that reality; it takes little account of society's swift changes, especially those regarding economic conditions. Rather, it seems to deal with more fundamental layers of communal human life and with its psychological preconditions, which have changed only slightly from the earliest times until now. If religious forms have often provided a focal point for new social and economic developments, they were more a prerequisite than a consequence of these developments."

1-2:  "Aggression and human violence have marked the progress of our civilization and appear, indeed to have grown so during its course that they have become a central problem of the present. Analyses that attempt to locate the roots of the evil often set out with shortsighted assumptions, as though the failure of our upbringing or the faulty development of a particular national tradition or economic system were to blame. More can be said for the thesis that all orders and forms of authority in human society are founded on institutionalized violence. This at least corresponds to the fundamental role played in biology by intraspecific aggression, as described by Konrad Lorenz. Those, however, who turn to religion for salvation from this 'so-called evil' of aggression are confronted with murder at the very core of Christianity--the death of God's innocent son; still earlier, the Old Testament covenant could come about only after Abraham had decided to sacrifice his child. Thus, blood and violence lurk fascinatingly at the very heart of religion."

2:  "for this is the act of piety: bloodshed, slaughter--and eating."

2:  "The worshipper experiences the god most powerfully not just in pious conduct or in prayer, song, and dance, but in the deadly blow of the axe, the gush of blood and the burning of thigh-pieces."

3:  "Sacrificial killing is the basic experience of the 'sacred.' *Homo religiosus* acts and attains self-awareness as *homo necans*."

3-4:  "Generally it is hoped that the animal will follow the procession compliantly or even willingly. Legends often tell of animals that offered themselves up for sacrifice, apparent evidence of a higher will that commands assent."

5:  "The 'act' is over; its consequences are the next concern. The animal is carved up and disembowelled. Its inner organs are now the main focus, lying revealed, an alien, bizarre, and uncanny sight, and yet common in the same form to men as well, as is known from seeing wounded soldiers."

6:  "In general, however, the *σπλάγχνα* [viscera]--the collective term for the organs--are quickly roasted in the fire from the altar and eaten at once. Thus the inner circle of active participants is brought together in a communal meal, transforming horror into pleasure. Only the bile is inedible and has to be disposed of. Likewise, the bones are not to be used for the subsequent meal, so they are 'consecrated' beforehand. The bones, above all the thigh-bones (*μηρία*) and the pelvis with the tail (*ὀσφύς*), are put on the alter 'in the proper order.' From the bones, one can still see exactly how the parts of the living animal fit together: its basic form is restored and consecrated."

7:  "This rite is objectionable, and was already felt to be so early on, because it so clearly and directly benefits man. Is the god 'to whom' the sacrifice is made any more than a transparent excuse for festive feasting? All he gets are the bones, the fat, and the gall bladders."

8:  "This book [Theophrastus's *On Piety*] explained animal sacrifice as having replaced cannibalism, which, in turn, had been forced on men because of difficult times."

12:  "a triad of sacrificial festivals emerges which yet adheres to the same unchangeable rhythm: the preliminary sacrifice, the terrifying sacrifice, and the victorious, affirming sacrifice. The core is always the experience of death brought upon by human violence, which, in turn, is here subject to predetermined laws. And this is nearly always connected with another human--all too human--action, namely, eating: the festive meal of those who share in the sacred."

15:  "One could, of course, try to cut through these correspondences with conceptual distinctions, and separate hunting and sacrifice on principle. In the hunt, one might argue, killing is not ceremonial but practical and subject to chance; its meaning and goal, both quite profane, lie in obtaining meat for food; a wild beast must be seen in opposition to a tame domestic animal. And yet the very similarity of hunting and sacrificial customs belies such a distinction. Killing can become ceremonial even among hunters. [...] On the other hand, the hunting situation is often evoked and acted out in later civilizations, as if one had to catch a wild beast so as to sacrifice it at a predetermined place."

16:  "The ritual provides forgiveness and reparation, though frequently taking on a scurrilous character which prompted Meuli to coin the phrase 'the comedy of innocence.' The ritual betrays an underlying anxiety about the continuation of life in the face of death. The blood 'act' was necessary for the continuance of life, but it is just as necessary for new life to be able to start again. Thus, the gathering of bones, the raising of a skull or stretching of a skin is to be understood as an attempt at restoration, a resurrection in the most concrete sense. The hope that the sources of nourishment will continue to exist, and the fear that they will not, determine the action of the hunter, killing to live."

17:  "The transition to the hunt is, rather, one of the most decisive ecological changes between man and the other primates. Man can virtually be defined as 'the hunting ape' (even if 'the naked ape' makes a more appealing title)."

17:  Given the overwhelming amount of evolutionary history of *homo sapiens* being Palaeolithic (between 95 and 99 percent) in comparison to the roughly 10,000 years of agriculture, "From this perspective, then, we can understand man's terrifying violence as deriving from the behavior of the predatory animal, whose characteristics he came to acquire in the course of becoming man." Therefore endorses a version of evolutionary psychology. However, notes that humans could only become 'hunting ape' through (1) adoption of weapons, first bone club and then fire-hardened wooden spear for throwing and (2) sexual division of labour in complex social forms. 

18:  "The success of the 'hunting ape' was due to his ability to work cooperatively, to unite with other men in a communal hunt. Thus, man ever since the development of hunting has belonged to two overlapping social structures, the family and the *Männerbund*; his world falls into pairs of categories: indoors and out, security and adventure, women's work and men's work, love and death. At the core of this new type of male community, which is biologically analogous to a pack of wolves, are the acts of killing and eating. The men must constantly move between the two realms, and their male children must one day take the difficult step from the women's world to the world of men. Fathers must accept their sons, educating them and looking after them--this, too, has no parallel among mammals. When a boy finally enters the world of men, he does so by confronting death."

18:  "What an experience it must have been when man, the relative of the chimpanzee, succeeded in seizing the power of his deadly enemy, the leopard, in assuming the traits of the world, forsaking the role of the hunted for that of the hunter! But success brought its own dangers. The earliest technology created the tools for killing. Even the wooden spear and wedge provided man with weapons more dangerous than his instincts could cope with. His rudimentary killing inhibitions were insufficient as soon as he could kill at a distance; and males were even educated to suppress these inhibitions for the sake of the hunt. Moreover, it is as easy, or even easier, to kill a man as it is to kill a fleeing beast, so from earliest times men slipped repeatedly into cannibalism. Thus, from the very start, self-destruction was a threat to the human race."

19:  "A man had to be courageous to take part in the hunt; therefore, courage is always included in the conception of an ideal man. A man had to be reliable, able to wait, to resist a momentary impulse for the sake of a long-range goal. He had to have endurance and keep to his word. In these matters men developed behavior patterns that were lacking in anthropoid apes and were closely analogous to the behavior of beasts of prey. Above all, the use of weapons was controlled by the strictest--if also artificial--rules: what was allowed and necessary in one realm was absolutely forbidden in the other."

20:  "it is precisely group demonstration of aggression toward outsiders that creates a sense of close personal community."

20:  "Because the hunter's activity was reinforced by behavior aimed originally at a human partner--that is, through intraspecific aggression--in place of a biologically fixed relationship of beast and quarry, something curious occurred: the quarry became a quasi-human adversary, experienced as human and treated accordingly. Hunting concentrated on the great mammals, which conspicuously resembled men in their body structure and movements, their eyes and their 'faces,' their breath and voices, in fleeing and in fear, in attacking and in rage. Most of all, this similarity with man was to be recognized in killing and slaughtering: the flesh was like flesh, bones like bones, phallus like phallus, and heart like heart, and, most important of all, the warm running blood was the same. One could, perhaps, most clearly grasp the animal's resemblance to man when it died. Thus, the quarry turned into a sacrificial victim."

22:  "man became man through the hunt, through the act of killing."

22-3:  "Although sacrifice began in the hunt, it appeared at its most meticulous and brilliant in the ancient city cultures, and at its most gruesome in Aztec civilization. It maintained its form and perhaps even acquired its purely religious function outside the context in which killing was necessary for life. For the action to be thus redirected and maintained, there had to be ritualization."

23:  "the two basic characteristics of ritual behavior, namely, repetition and theatrical exaggeration: For the essentially immutable patterns do not transmit differentiated and complex information but, rather, just one piece of information each. This single piece of information is considered so important that it is reinforced by constant repetition so as to avoid misunderstanding or misuse. The fact of understanding is thus more important than what is understood. Above all, then, ritual creates and affirms social interaction."

26:  "Those who will not or cannot conform to the rituals of a society have no chance in it."

27-8:  "Ideas do not produce ritual; rather, ritual itself produces and shapes ideas, or even experiences and emotions."

33:  "The most exciting themes in myth come from the realm of sexuality and aggression, and these are also prominent in ritual communication. The most fascinating stories concern the perils of death and destruction. These have their counterparts in sacrificial killing."

34:  "In hunting and then in sacrifice, aggressive modes of behavior between men are diverted onto animals; in the myth, on the other hand, is a human victim."

34:  "There has yet to be a community without ritual."

35:  "a sense of community arises from collective aggression."

35:  "Whether in Israel, Greece, or Rome, no agreement, no contract, no alliance can be made without a sacrifice. And, in the language of the oath, the object of aggression that is to be 'stuck' and 'cut' becomes virtually identical with the covenant itslef: *foedus ferire* [strike/cut an agreement], *ὅρκια πιστὰ τέμνειν*."

36:  "It is in the sacrificial procession that the empire's power becomes manifest."

36:  "The closer the bond, the more gruesome the ritual. Those who swear an oath must touch the blood from the accompanying sacrifice and even step on the testicles of the castrated victim. They must eat the meat of the victim as well, or at least the *σπλάγχνα*."

37:  "The sacrificial community is thus a model of society as a whole, divided according to occupation and rank. Hence, the hierarchies manifested in the ceremony are given great social importance and are taken very seriously."

43:  "We find a transitional phase documented at Çatal Hüyük. The most important religious symbol in this farming town where goat and sheep had long been domesticated was a pair of horns from the wild bull, and wall paintings contain clear, thrilling depictions of the ritual hunt of a band of leopard men. We can even trace the gradual extinction of wild cattle in Çatal Hüyük, though not the critical step that followed: in place of the dwindling bands of wild animals, domestic ones were now used for sacrifice. The animal must, of course, now be removed from the everyday world; it must become sacred. Hence the adornment and the procession, and, sometimes, the animal being set free and recaptured."

45:  "Contracts are sealed with libations of wine (*σπονδαι*), and weddings are celebrated by cutting up cake or bread; cutting or breaking must still precede eating, just as slaughter precedes the eating of meat."

45:  Notes that in Greece, all sacrificial victims were animal, but in the tropics--with climates favourable to crop growth--human sacrifice, including cannibalism, was routinely practiced.

45:  "Civilized life endures only by giving a ritual form to the brute force that still lurks in men."

46:  "Deprived of its hunting quarry, the secret society makes the initiand himself into a victim. The group's aggression becomes focused on this man and he is forthwith killed--symbolically, of course; a sacrificial animal is substituted at the last minute. However, the bloodshed and the refined methods of torture are very real and guarantee the seriousness of the ritual. The gruesome 'evil' at work in the ritual fulfills a function, i.e., to preserve a social structure over the course of generations. Once again, life rises up from the peril of death. Indeed, the individual experiences himself how, after life had been endangered, there is a resurrection, a rebirth."

47:  There is another, far more serious, way to divert aggression toward the outside world: by integrating large groups of men in a common fighting spirit, i.e., war."

47:  "War is ritual, a self-portrayal and self-affirmation of male society. Male society finds stability in confronting death, in defying it through a display of readiness to die, and in the ecstasy of survival. Such modes of behavior are so bound up with the governmental systems and values of our society that even today, when modern military technology has made war so distant that its absurdity is patent, when it is beginning to be the source of discord rather than of solidarity, still final emancipation from war lies far in the future."

47:  "For the ancient world, hunting, sacrifice, and war were symbolically interchangeable."

48:  "As a rule, the Greeks' *σπονδαι* [treaty, truce] were for a period of thirty years at most. Each generation has the right and obligation to have its war."

49:  "the Palaeolithic era, in which burial evolved, was also the age of hunting. Thus, the ritual of hunting and sacrificing accompanied the funerary ritual from the start, each influencing the other. In prehistory and ethology it generally holds true that dead men and dead animals are treated alike: both rituals deal with death."

49:  "Homo sapiens is also homo necans and homo sepelians [burying]."

50:  "The most widespread element in funerals--so obvious it may seem hardly worth mentioning--is the role played by eating, i.e., the fenerary meal."

50:  "At first the necessary combination of death and eating appeared only in the hunt. Starting here, the ritual meal functioned as a bond within the community. This is not to say that cannibalism was the earliest form of honoring the dead. The ritualization of hunting behavior made possible a twofold transferral: the dead could take the place of the quarry--a substitute more serious than what it replaces--but in the subsequent feast, his place could in turn be taken by the sacrificial animal."

52:  "The rhythm of the hunting ritual is, thus, repeated: death/tearing apart/restoration."

59:  "Whether it be a stick or a club, a spear or a sword, a gun or a cannon, as a symbol of masculinity the weapon has been equivalent to and almost interchangeable with the sexual organs from Stone Age drawings to modern advertising."

60-1:  "Precisely because the act of killing is sexually charged, sexual abstinence is frequently a part of preparing for sacrifice, for war, and for the hunt."

65:  "Among the Greeks, preliminary maiden-sacrifice is for the most part a prelude to war."

67:  "In the paradox that both the god of the hunt and the god of war were 'virgins' we observe the sexual tensions, the frustration and symbolic substitution, upon which hunting and warring behavior feeds."

68:  "When stimulated by sexual jealousy, the destructive rage operating in the battle of man against man will turn against the adversary's masculinity: when killed, a warrior is immediately castrated. This has occurred regularly in wars up until recent times, and it appears to be a basic element in man's fighting instinct."

71:  "A large phallus would be built from a beam, painted with wax colors, and equipped with large wooden wings. The phallus-bird has long been known to us from an often-reproduced votive offering on Delos and from the art of Attic vase-painters. In the Delian ritual, however, it was driven on a lead-weighted wagon down the 'river'; while the wagon sank in the water, the phallus-bird floated out to sea and out of sight. This phallagogia is clearly a closing ritual, for the act of worship includes disposing of the object of worship."

71:  "The larger the phallus, the greater the element of humor..."

72:  "Orgies and death are close neighbors."

75:  "Conscious killing is a kind of patricide."
