xxi-n3:  "Especially dangerous is the little word *is*, which confounds translation, allegory, classification, and ontological or psychological realization."

xxiii:  "Within historical reality, religion is a stabilizing factor of the first order in society. As such it appears in its enduring aspect, always a given tradition which is modified time and again but never replaced by something entirely new. As it unfolds within the many-faceted play of social forces, various traditions unite, thereby asserting and perpetuating themselves or languishing and dying out. In this respect, religion, while tied to social reality, does not simply reflect that reality; it takes little account of society's swift changes, especially those regarding economic conditions. Rather, it seems to deal with more fundamental layers of communal human life and with its psychological preconditions, which have changed only slightly from the earliest times until now. If religious forms have often provided a focal point for new social and economic developments, they were more a prerequisite than a consequence of these developments."

1-2:  "Aggression and human violence have marked the progress of our civilization and appear, indeed to have grown so during its course that they have become a central problem of the present. Analyses that attempt to locate the roots of the evil often set out with shortsighted assumptions, as though the failure of our upbringing or the faulty development of a particular national tradition or economic system were to blame. More can be said for the thesis that all orders and forms of authority in human society are founded on institutionalized violence. This at least corresponds to the fundamental role played in biology by intraspecific aggression, as described by Konrad Lorenz. Those, however, who turn to religion for salvation from this 'so-called evil' of aggression are confronted with murder at the very core of Christianity--the death of God's innocent son; still earlier, the Old Testament covenant could come about only after Abraham had decided to sacrifice his child. Thus, blood and violence lurk fascinatingly at the very heart of religion."

2:  "for this is the act of piety: bloodshed, slaughter--and eating."

2:  "The worshipper experiences the god most powerfully not just in pious conduct or in prayer, song, and dance, but in the deadly blow of the axe, the gush of blood and the burning of thigh-pieces."

3:  "Sacrificial killing is the basic experience of the 'sacred.' *Homo religiosus* acts and attains self-awareness as *homo necans*."

3-4:  "Generally it is hoped that the animal will follow the procession compliantly or even willingly. Legends often tell of animals that offered themselves up for sacrifice, apparent evidence of a higher will that commands assent."

5:  "The 'act' is over; its consequences are the next concern. The animal is carved up and disembowelled. Its inner organs are now the main focus, lying revealed, an alien, bizarre, and uncanny sight, and yet common in the same form to men as well, as is known from seeing wounded soldiers."

6:  "In general, however, the σπλάγχνα [viscera]--the collective term for the organs--are quickly roasted in the fire from the altar and eaten at once. Thus the inner circle of active participants is brought together in a communal meal, transforming horror into pleasure. Only the bile is inedible and has to be disposed of. Likewise, the bones are not to be used for the subsequent meal, so they are 'consecrated' beforehand. The bones, above all the thigh-bones (μηρία) and the pelvis with the tail (ὀσφύς), are put on the alter 'in the proper order.' From the bones, one can still see exactly how the parts of the living animal fit together: its basic form is restored and consecrated."

7:  "This rite is objectionable, and was already felt to be so early on, because it so clearly and directly benefits man. Is the god 'to whom' the sacrifice is made any more than a transparent excuse for festive feasting? All he gets are the bones, the fat, and the gall bladders."

8:  "This book [Theophrastus's *On Piety*] explained animal sacrifice as having replaced cannibalism, which, in turn, had been forced on men because of difficult times."
